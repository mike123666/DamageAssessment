John Gulserian, program manager of the county's emergency services office, said any earthquake would need to be closer to impact the area.\n\n\"It happens fairly often,\" Gulserian said of earthquakes.\n\nThe first quake, magnitude 5.7, hit at 12:18 a.m. It was followed by a 5.7 earthquake at 12:22 a.m. A 5.5 quake hit at 1:13 a.m.\n\n\"I felt a couple jolts that lasted a few seconds,\" Karen Jacobson Kipp said in a message. \"Our home is built on a raised foundation, as we are on a hill, so I heard a creak and a couple small jolts. My dog barked. That's about it.\"\n\nThe Mineral County Sheriff's Department in Hawthorne, Nevada, near the epicenter, has not had any reports of injury or damage. The office says the quakes apparently set off burglar alarms at two businesses, and caused a rock slide that did not block a nearby highway.\n\nRecommended Stories For You\n\nIn addition to Lake Tahoe, the United States Geological Survey said the quakes were felt in such areas as Carson City, Nevada, and Yosemite National Park and Mammoth Lakes in California, all roughly 60 miles from the epicenter.\n\nThe three quakes were recorded 18 miles southwest of Hawthorne, with 13 recorded aftershocks, said Graham Kent, director of Nevada Seismological Laboratory.\n\nKent said there were three main shocks that occurred along a fault line with aftershocks producing throughout the morning all over Northern Nevada and as far as San Francisco and Central California.\n\nOne Carson City resident wrote, \"They are very rolling \u2014 seems to be those in Hawthorne I'm feeling most. And can hear a low rumbling with those big ones \u2014 shakes my lights and wind chimes.\"\n\n\"If it had been under Reno, this would have been a very significant event,\" Kent said.\n\nThe quakes did cause several Carson City business alarms to go off with the motion, which tied up deputies for some time, however, no serious incidents occurred.\n\nPrior to the earthquakes rattling Hawthorne, the USGS also showed a small cluster of quakes in the Mammoth area 65 direct miles southwest of Hawthorne and Ridgecrest, Calif., which is home to Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. The Mammoth area has a history of earthquake activity.\n\nAftershocks (a smaller earthquake following the main shock of a large earthquake) ranging from magnitude 1.2 to 3.1 continued to hit the area with 16 aftershocks reported between 6:20 a.m. to 8 a.m. in an area 19 miles southwest of Hawthorne and 18-19 miles northeast of Bridgeport. Much of the activity, according to maps, places much of the earthquake activity due east of Bodie, Calif., an old mining town that's a popular visitor attraction.\n\nNevada is one of the top three states noted for its earthquake activity. The other two are Alaska and California. Kent said the area where the earthquakes occur is notorious for a number of small fault lines.\n\nTwo of the most powerful Nevada earthquakes in modern times occurred in 1954 east of Fallon in the Dixie Valley-Fairview area. They were recorded at magnitude 6.8 and 7.1. A magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck Pleasant Valley, 40 miles northeast of Winnemucca in 1915. Wells was rocked by a magnitude 6.0 quake on Feb. 21, 2008, which caused more than $10 million in damage. Kent said that was the last time they had a major pattern of earthquakes.\n\nKent said they also can't rule out the possibility of a fourth earthquake still, though they don't believe it's likely.\n\nEARTHQUAKE TIPS\n\nIn case of earthquake activity, Be Prepared: Before, During and After an Earthquake\n\nDo you know how to prepare for and survive a major earthquake? According to the California Department of Conservation scientists, it will be critical to have the right answer to that question somewhere at sometime in the coming years. Many people think having bottled water on hand is a good idea. That's true, as long as you have enough. Many are certain standing in a doorway during the shaking is a good idea. That's false, unless you live in an unreinforced adobe structure; otherwise, you're more likely to be hurt by the door swinging wildly in a doorway or trampled by people trying to hurry outside if you're in a public place.\n\nHow to be Prepared\n\nElectricity, water, gas and telephones may not be working after an earthquake. The police and fire departments are likely to be tied up. You should be prepared to fend for yourself for at least three days, preferably for a week.\n\nYou'll need food and water (a gallon a day per person); a first aid kit; a fire extinguisher suitable for all types of fires; flashlights; a portable radio; extra batteries, blankets, clothes, shoes and money (ATMs may not work); medication; an adjustable or pipe wrench to turn off gas or water, if necessary; baby and pet food; and an alternate cooking source (barbecue or camp stove). This list can also be applied to other disasters, such as floods or wildfires.\n\nIt's also a good idea to decide beforehand how and where your family will reunite if separated during a quake and to conduct in-home practice drills. You might choose an out-of-the-area friend or relative family members can call to check on you.\n\nSecuring water heaters, major appliances and tall, heavy furniture to prevent them from toppling are prudent steps. So, too, are storing hazardous or flammable liquids, heavy objects and breakables on low shelves or in secure cabinets.\n\nDiscuss earthquake insurance with your agent. Depending on your financial situation and the value of your home, it may be worthwhile.\n\nDuring an Earthquake\n\nIf you're indoors, stay there. Get under \u2014 and hold onto \u2014 a desk or table, or stand against an interior wall. Stay clear of exterior walls, glass, heavy furniture, fireplaces and appliances. The kitchen is a particularly dangerous spot. If you're in an office building, stay away from windows and outside walls and don't use the elevator.\n\nIf you're outside, get into the open. Stay clear of buildings, power lines or anything else that could fall on you.\n\nIf you're driving, move the car out of traffic and stop. Avoid parking under or on bridges or overpasses. Try to get clear of trees, light posts, signs and power lines. When you resume driving, watch out for road hazards.\n\nIf you're in a mountainous area, beware of the potential for landslides. Likewise, if you're near the ocean, be aware tsunamis are associated with large earthquakes. Get to high ground.\n\nIf you're in a crowded public place, avoid panicking and don't rush for the exit. Stay low and cover your head and neck with your hands and arms.\n\nAfter an Earthquake\n\nCheck for fire or fire hazards. If you smell gas, shut off the main gas valve. If there's evidence of damage to electrical wiring, shut off the power at the control box.\n\nIf the phone is working, only use it in case of emergency. Likewise, avoid driving if possible to keep the streets clear for emergency vehicles.\n\nBe aware items may fall out of cupboards or closets when the door is opened, and also chimneys can be weakened and fall with a touch. Check for cracks and damage to the roof and foundation of your home.\n\nListen to the radio for important information and instructions. Remember that aftershocks, sometimes large enough to cause damage in their own right, generally follow large quakes.\n\nIf you leave home, leave a message telling friends and family your location.\n\nUpdated information for activity associated with this earthquake is available at http://www.seismo.unr.edu[unr.pr-optout.com].\n\nSteve Ranson of the Lohotan Valley News, Taylor Pettaway of the Nevada Appeal and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "title": "Earthquake felt in Nevada County, though no issues reported"}, {"url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/earthquakes/seven-osage-county-residents-sue-oil-companies-for-damages-from/article_5d41e627-4eba-5d48-b0ea-2c5215d07e95.html", "content": "Close Get email notifications on Staff Writer Corey Jones daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\nWhenever Staff Writer Corey Jones posts new content, you'll get an email delivered to your inbox with a link.\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.", "title": "Seven Osage County residents sue oil companies for damages from Pawnee, Cushing earthquakes"}], "occurence_date": "21 Feb 2008", "occurence_timestamp": 1203603362821, "magnitude": 5.9, "actual_city": "Wells, Nevada"}, {"news": [{"url": "https://www.ilnews.org/news/outdoorsenvironment/two-quakes-shake-southern-illinois-within-two-weeks/article_0d369f92-a23b-11e7-a405-abf6f36465a9.html", "content": "You are the owner of this article.", "title": "Two quakes shake southern Illinois within two weeks"}, {"url": "https://www.myjournalcourier.com/features/article/Earthquakes-in-Illinois-have-destructive-history-12584897.php", "content": "Earthquakes in Illinois have destructive history\n\nMost of the nation\u2019s costliest earthquakes have occurred in the Pacific region, from California to Alaska. Illinois has not \u2014 at least, not yet \u2014 suffered such devastation.\n\nThanks to a series of small faults that crisscross southern Illinois, tremors occasionally are felt across the state and usually do little more than rattle nerves.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say damaging earthquakes are unheard of in the state.\n\nThe best known earthquake to rock Illinois was the New Madrid event of 1811-1812, which actually was a series of three quakes. Though the Richter scale had not been created, various estimates place the New Madrid quakes in a range from 7.0 to 8.0 on the scale. According to the Illinois State Geological Survey, that event was the largest release of seismic energy ever documented in the continental United States.\n\nThose quakes struck six years before Illinois attained statehood and, with population sparse among the territory, there was minimal loss of life and property damage. The New Madrid quakes were 16 years after the first reported earthquake in the Illinois region, a 90-second shaker in 1795 at Kaskaskia.\n\nFortunately, nothing has matched the New Madrid event in Illinois history, though there have been some notable shakers. Among them was a quake on Nov. 9, 1968, measuring 5.4 on the Richter scale; it was centered in Hamilton County in southern Illinois. Felt across 23 states and as far away as Boston, that quake caused considerable damage in McLeansboro, including at the local high school.\n\nAn estimated 90 percent of county buildings in McLeansboro, including the courthouse, sustained some form of physical compromise. Damage to chimney and walls also was reported in St. Louis, while windows broke as far away as Alton.\n\nIronically, the 1968 quake came 10 years and one day after a 4.4 tremor in the same area caused plaster to fall and walls to crack in several southern Illinois towns.\n\nTwo significant earthquakes hit Illinois in 1909, the first an estimated 5.1 quake near Aurora on May 26 that brought down chimneys in Streator, Troy Grove and as far away as Waukegan. Reports of cracks in walls also were received in Bloomington.\n\nThat July 19, an estimated 4.8 quake centered between Havana and Petersburg resulted in some of the worst damage in Illinois outside the New Madrid quake of a century before. More than 100 chimneys were wiped out in Petersburg while, at a farm west of town, some 20 windows were broken and bricks above doors were knocked out. Collapsed chimneys also were reported in Springfield and as far away as Davenport, Iowa.\n\nAlso hitting the Quad Cities was a 4.0 quake centered near Rock Island on Nov. 12, 1934. It dropped bricks from some chimneys and halted pendulums on a few clocks. At Augustana College in Rock Island, loose plaster was dislodged from a men\u2019s dormitory, while a stucco cornice was knocked off St. Joseph\u2019s School. Loose bricks also were scattered from a few structures in the area.\n\nOn June 27, 1881, an estimated 4.6 tremor in the southwest part of La Salle caused six parallel fissures that could be seen running northwest-southeast for 183 miles. The shaking cracked walls, foundations and furnaces in the local bottle and glass factories.\n\nOn Sept. 27, 1882, an overnight quake estimated at 4.4 woke up people across the region and badly cracked a chimney in Greenfield.\n\nOther damaging Illinois tremors include a 5.1 quake in April 1917 that shifted buildings from foundations in Granite City, an an August 1965 tremor that measured only 3.4, yet caused significant damage in Tamms. A 4.0 tremor was recorded on Sept. 15, 1972, near Amboy in Lee County, while a 4.2 quake hit on June 28, 2004, near Prairie Center in La Salle County.\n\nElsewhere in southern Illinois, a 4.8 quake in November 1922 brought down chimneys and cracked windows in Eldorado in Saline County. Many in Illinois felt a 6.8 quake centered near Charleston, Missouri, on Halloween 1895, the last strong quake to hit the Midwest.\n\nMore recent Illinois quakes include a 5.0 event near Olney on June 10, 1987, that was felt in 16 states and left minor damage, especially in Lawrence and Richland counties. A 5.0 quake was felt on June 18, 2002, near Mount Vernon.\n\nAt 4:37 a.m. April 18, 2008, an earthquake measuring 5.2 was centered near Mount Carmel and felt as far away as Canada, setting news programs and social media abuzz. Some structural damage was reported in communities near the epicenter. Ironically, it was the 102nd anniversary of the destructive San Francisco quake that cost an estimated 3,000 lives.\n\nThe 2008 quake occurred along the Wabash Valley Fault, which has produced most of the recent southern Illinois tremors. In contrast, the more famous New Madrid fault has not produced a significant earthquake in decades.\n\nIn 2005, seismologists predicted a 90 percent chance that an earthquake of 6.0 to 7.0 would hit the Midwest again in the next half-century, likely on the Wabash Valley Fault. With urban centers such as St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago in close proximity, such an event could cause extensive damage.\n\nThe 2005 finding appears much stronger than 1990 claims from Iben Browningthat a severe New Madrid earthquake was imminent; his prediction still hasn\u2019t come true, but it left some Midwestern residents terrified of an impending disaster.\n\nTom Emery is a freelance writer and historical researcher from Carlinville.

Genevieve Seismic Zone runs along the Mississippi River from Cairo, Ill. towards St. Louis, Mo. Scientists installed a 140-station seismic network in Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky and detected many tiny earthquakes along the Ste. Genevieve Seismic Zone between July 2011 and June 2012. Most ranged in magnitude from 1.3 to 3.0 and were too small to be felt on the surface.\n\nResearcher Michael Hamburger from Indiana University said these instruments can record activity that is too small to be picked up by the regional seismic network.\n\n\u201cThe concentration of earthquake activity in this area along the Missouri-Illinois border caught our attention,\u201d Hamburger said.\n\nThe Ste. Genevieve system is comparable to the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone along the Illinois-Indiana border. That\u2019s the same system that shook the Midwest in 2008 with the 5.8 magnitude Mount Carmel earthquake.\n\n\u201cI think the potential for larger earthquakes in this area still remains unknown,\u201d Hamburger said. \u201cWe certainly know that there is a history of moderate size earthquakes in the range of magnitude 5.0 to 6.0 that have occurred in this area and suggest continuing earthquake hazards.\u201d\n\nThe seismic zone has implication because it is in a populated region that includes the cities of St. Louis, Cape Girardeau and Ste. Genevieve.\n\n\u201cThe seismic activity that we associate with earthquakes down in the southern Mississippi Valley could perhaps extend to areas further north,\u201d Hamburger said. \u201cThere could be additional sources of seismic risk that haven\u2019t been examined in detail yet.\u201d\n\nThe study \u201cSeismicity of the Ste.

That message has not been removed from the signage still on the building today, though the bar has long been shuttered.\n\nIn doing research on the history of the bar, I came across Nevada Myth #44 written by former Nevada State Archivist Guy Rocha. He wrote, \"The sign is misleading. While it is true the site of Jack's Bar has been home to various drinking establishments since 1859, the current building only dates back to 1899.\" No matter how you look at it that building had 103 years of serving customers in that very spot, no matter the name prior to its closing in June 2002.\n\nThe venerable bar had been known by many names that old-timers might remember. They might have hoisted a beer or enjoyed a shot. They may have lobbied a legislator or met their significant other. Working from the most recent name backwards: Jack's Bar became Jack's Bar in 1966. Prior to that, it was known as Angelo's, Y-Not Bar, Hernando's Hideaway and the Bank Resort. The first name of this bar was Bank Saloon.\n\nAs Rocha writes, this location has lots of history. A dance hall opened on that corner on July 4, 1859. In 1862, it was the Frisbie Hotel and in 1873, it was referred to as the Fifth Avenue House. The wrecking ball hit it in 1892 \u2014 then one of the oldest landmark hotels in the city.\n\nIt was 1899, that the structure was rebuilt of the sandstone quarried from the Nevada State Prison and opened as the Bank Saloon on Aug. 19. The Carson Appeal reported the opening, \"The place is without exception the handsomest building in this city and is an ornament that will remain for years to come as it is built of stone and in a substantial manner.\" It even remained standing after three fires hit the block and was the go to bar on the fringe of the red light district \u2014 yes, we had one of those, but not since the feds shut down the district in 1942. The last fire in was on April 19, 1998.\n\nToday, the historic structure remains a blight at a popular corner, The historic stones are further deteriorating, paint is peeling, weeds are growing at the crumbling base and some windows are boarded. An interior pully is holding up the leaning walls.\n\nRecommended Stories For You\n\nThe structure was placed on the National Register of Historic Places Aug. 7, 2008. According to an article in the Nevada Appeal (May 22, 2006), a seismic assessment was conducted in 2003 to determine the feasibility of reopening the bar. As reported, the cost then estimated to stabilize the building was about $100,000.", "title": "It wasn\u2019t always known as Jack\u2019s Bar"}, {"url": "https://phys.org/news/2017-12-ancient-mastodon-ignited-debate-humans.html", "content": "\"Oh my God,\" Richard Cerutti said to himself. He bent down to pick up a sharp, splintered bone fragment. Its thickness and weight told him that it belonged to an animal, a very big animal. His mind started to race.\n\nHe was standing at the foot of a slope being groomed by the California Department of Transportation for a road-widening project through the Sweetwater Valley near National City.\n\nEarthmoving equipment had already uncovered other fossils from elsewhere on the site, mostly rodents, birds and lizards. But this bone was from no ordinary animal. The operator wanted to keep digging, but Cerutti raised a fist to stop him. He felt a tightening knot of anger.\n\nThe contractors had worked over the weekend without contacting him, and he could see the damage they had done. He sprinted up the slope to a construction trailer and picked up a telephone.\n\n\"Tom,\" he said. \"I think I have a mammoth out here on State Route 54. Can you send some help?\"\n\nBack on site, Cerutti persuaded the operator to move the excavator out of the way. He grabbed a few tools from his truck: an ice pick, an old paintbrush and his prized table knife lifted from a Black Angus restaurant.\n\nKneeling among broken bones, he dusted away loose soil and began probing the sediment. His adrenaline surged as the outline of a tusk slowly emerged. Inches from the tusk, he found a stone. One edge was smooth, almost rounded. The other was sharp as a razor.\n\nCerutti had made stone tools before, and he knew how rocks fracture and break. Nothing about the shape of this rock was natural; something had struck and broken it with great force.\n\nWhat the hell had he stumbled upon?\n\nCerutti hardly suspected that on this day, Nov. 16, 1992, he was standing atop a discovery that could rewrite the opening chapter in the history of the New World.\n\nNow retired, Richard Cerutti, 76, lived for these moments.\n\nThe fascination began when he was a boy eyeing a friend's collection of ancient shark teeth, and it led to paleontology, the study of Earth's history through its fossil record.\n\nIn 1980, Cerutti found his dream job as a construction-site monitor for the San Diego Natural History Museum. With a quick eye and an easy temperament, he could spot bones in tumbled debris and talk down construction crews with schedules to keep. Sucking diesel fumes was a small price for the privilege of stepping back in time.\n\nTom Demere, who answered Cerutti's phone call, was the museum's curator of paleontology. Demere was better versed in the evolution of ancient whales and pinnipeds than mammoths, but he knew Cerutti was not one to raise false alarms.\n\nThe two men first met after Cerutti wrote to ask if the museum might be interested in some fossils he had found. Such offers from the public were not unusual, but claims of their significance were often overblown.\n\nBut when Cerutti opened the trunk of his Rambler, Demere gasped. Overnight, Cerutti's bones, wrapped in linen and old T-shirts, doubled the museum's collection of vertebrate fossils.\n\nDemere moved quickly; a mammoth would be rare but not surprising.\n\nConstruction projects in the San Diego area had uncovered a wealth of fossils, including a previously unknown species of walrus, nearly 3 million years old, and a never-before-discovered armored dinosaur from the Cretaceous Period about 75 million years ago.\n\nDemere visited the site the next day. He found Cerutti and his team of field paleontologists standing at the foot of the slope.\n\nThey had swept the site clean of the loose sediment and collected the broken bones, the pieces of tusks and the stones damaged by the excavator. A few molar fragments told them that the mammoth was a mastodon, a shorter and stockier relative.\n\nWith foot-long galvanized nails and rebar, string and flags, the team divided the site into 1 meter squares. They washed and screened sediment, borrowing water and electricity from a homeowner whose backyard overlooked the dig.\n\nMost surprising was how smashed up the specimens were. \"Mastodon leg bones are like pier pilings,\" Cerutti said, \"and these were broken to hell.\"\n\nWhat could have caused this?\n\nThey dug into the slope, primarily following a stratum of silty sandstone no more than a foot thick, sediment laid down\u2014by their estimates\u2014nearly 120,000 years ago, by a meandering river, pushed back by rising seas.\n\nCould these bones be that old?\n\nLate on the afternoon of Dec. 11, the paleontologists began sculpting dirt from around a second tusk. It was jammed almost straight down.\n\nThey worked into the dying light. They did not want to leave it overnight; the ivory would tempt vandals. When they finally extracted the tusk, they marveled at its beauty and wondered what could have pushed it, tip-first, into the ground.\n\nBy now, though, they were accustomed to unanswered questions.\n\nMastodon leg bones are like pier pilings, and these were broken to hell.\n\nDemere brought in two experts from Northern Arizona University\u2014Larry Agenbroad and Jim Mead\u2014who spent more than a week at the site. They helped excavate two of the most remarkable squares, where the assortment of fossils was especially dense: ribs, long fragments of femurs with spiral fractures, two molars, vertebrae and a cobblestone.\n\nAt the center of this collection were two femur heads, detached from their shafts and nearly touching, one hemisphere facing up, the other facing down.\n\nThe team wondered how this could be. Mastodon femurs\u2014those pier pilings\u2014are almost 3 feet long and up to 8 inches in diameter. What could have detached these heads from their shafts and positioned them side by side? Next to them was a large boulder that somehow seemed implicated.\n\nThey tried not to speculate but kept returning to the possibility that humans might have been here, broken these bones and walked away. That meant the evidence they left behind\u2014all this debris\u2014was almost the same age as the sediments that eventually buried the site.\n\nIt was heresy, maybe even lunacy.\n\nFor nearly half a century, schoolchildren have been taught that the first human visitors to the New World belonged to the Clovis culture, known for chipped-stone spear points first discovered in New Mexico.\n\nArchaeologists say these people crossed the Bering Land Bridge from Asia about 12,000 years ago.\n\nTo dispute Clovis-first by a few thousand years was controversial. Some archaeologists had won begrudging acceptance with a few scattered excavations.\n\nBut to propose a site more than 100,000 years older was professional suicide. It would undermine the research and reputations of most archaeologists studying the New World.\n\n\"If you claim something is that old, you get blasted,\" Cerutti said, \"which is why some archaeologists stopped working on sites like this. They didn't want to get blasted.\"\n\nThe paleontologists tried to find an alternative theory.\n\nCould these bones have been broken by construction equipment or by other animals? Perhaps another mastodon? If so, then why were more fragile bones, like ribs, still intact?\n\nCould a mudflow have swept in the large cobblestones? Maybe, but wouldn't a mudflow have also swept away, even destroyed, the smaller skeletons of birds and lizards they'd also found at the site?\n\nAnd what about the cobblestones? There were five of them, ranging from 9 to 30 pounds, caught in this sedimentary layer of fine-grained sand. Why weren't there more?\n\nFor that matter, why hadn't they found more of the mastodon's skeleton, especially the large pieces like the skull, the pelvis, and the scapulas?\n\nAgenbroad, who had made his reputation at the famed mammoth graveyard in South Dakota, was flummoxed. He could not accept the presence of man on the North American continent so long ago.\n\n\"'Anomaly' is the key word for this site as far as I'm concerned,\" he said. \"There are anomalous fragments of rocks, anomalous fragments of tooth enamel scattered throughout the site that\u2014and here he paused between words for effect\u2014just ... don't ... make ... sense in a natural depositional environment.\n\n\"If I didn't call this Highway 54 Mastodon, I would call it the Anomalous Mastodon Site.\"\n\nThe lack of consensus frustrated Cerutti. He knew that the San Diego museum supported the work, but he had also heard that some of his colleagues were saying he had been \"out in the sun too long.\"\n\nSo who were the first Americans? The answer, he feared, would have less to do with science than blood sport.\n\nBy the time the site played out after five months, 50 squares had been excavated. Nearly 400 specimens had been trucked to the museum. Cerutti and the team cleaned, preserved and cataloged them.\n\nDemere sent samples to a laboratory in Miami for radiocarbon dating, the gold standard for determining the age of archaeological sites.\n\nA report came back: There was not enough organic carbon\u2014collagen\u2014in the samples to allow them to date the critical isotope, C-14. But because organic carbon decomposes over time, the isotope's absence suggested that these specimens were probably older than Clovis culture.\n\nCorroboration came from a University of Southern California professor, Richard Ku, who had been dating other sites in Southern California using a new, if rudimentary, technique that measured changes in the uranium and thorium content of organic materials as they aged.\n\nKu worked with a portion of a tusk and a piece of the calcium carbonate, a hardened rind of minerals that had encrusted the specimens over the thousands of centuries underground.\n\nAfter a few months, Ku wrote back: The average age of the tusk and the rind was 191,000 years. As exciting as this was, it also seemed too old and felt like a setback. Had the team gotten something wrong?\n\nIn his final report completed in 1995, Demere hedged. He wrote that the spiral fractures in the femurs could have been produced \"by human activity\" or by simple \"torsion caused by twisting,\" what a panicked animal might do if its foot were sunk in mud.\n\nIn the years that followed, Demere invited other researchers to study the collection. But no one stepped forward.\n\nRobson Bonnichsen, an anthropologist at Oregon State University and the founder of the Center for the Study of Early Man, said, \"Your site may well be a candidate for one of the oldest archaeological sites ever found in the New World.\"\n\nBut he added: \"From my own bitter experience, I know that research that contributes to First American Studies is a game of hardball.\"\n\nGeorge Jefferson, former associate curator of the Page Museum in Los Angeles and district paleontologist for the California State Parks, was blunt: The archaeological community was not ready for such an unsettling claim of antiquity.\n\n\"Keep it under wraps,\" he said. \"No one will believe you.\"\n\nThe director of the San Diego museum asked Demere: \"When are you going to publish?\"\n\n\"I didn't know what to do,\" Demere said.\n\nMonths went by. Then years.\n\nCerutti stopped going near State Route 54. In 2000, he and his wife moved to a new home in the mountains east of San Diego. Three years later, a wildfire swept through the community. Their home was spared, but they eventually had to walk away.\n\nWorse, Cerutti had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and for two years he underwent chemotherapy. He began losing friends from the excavation, one from a suicide that he still cannot shake.\n\nHe felt hopeful when Steve Holen came to San Diego in 2008 with his wife and collaborator, Kathleen, at Demere's invitation.\n\nAs the curator of archaeology at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, Holen had heard about the Cerutti Mastodon Site, and upon retirement, he and Kathleen decided to look into the claims more carefully.\n\nThe couple set themselves up in Demere's research laboratory. Over two days, tray after tray of bones and rocks and cobblestones were brought to them, along with photographs, maps and videos from the site. Holen couldn't believe what he saw. It was just as Cerutti had thought: Someone had hit these bones with a tremendous force.\n\nHere were the signature signs of the impact: the small craters produced when a solid object strikes another, creating cone-shaped divots, like a BB does when it hits a pane of glass.\n\nHe also studied the calcium carbonate that covered the broken bones, shielding and preserving the original fractures\u2014essentially locking them in time\u2014more than 100,000 years ago.\n\n\"I was staring out into space with my mouth open,\" he said. \"I couldn't get my head around this. It goes against everything I was taught and all that I knew.\"\n\nHe discussed it with Demere, who realized that he had found his co-author. \"Finally, someone with the ... experience.\"\n\nTogether they prepared for battle.\n\nDemere and Holen assembled a team of paleontologists, archaeologists, geoarchaeologists, mastodon specialists, Paleo-Indian specialists, sedimentologists, geomorphologists, geochronologists and lithic fabrication specialists.\n\nEach scientist took an element of the site and applied their proficiency.\n\nOne concluded that there had been no raging torrents that might have crashed the stones and bones together in a seasonal fury.\n\nAnother focused on the fragments scattered around the site. The few pieces of bone that they found fit into the smooth spiral fractures, and the more plentiful stone fragments matched with the ragged edges of the cobblestones.\n\nStill another re-dated the site.\n\nMore than 20 years after Ku's work, the technology for uranium-thorium dating had improved, and there was a better understanding of the behavior of uranium in bone samples.\n\nJim Paces, a geochronologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Denver, took dozens of slices from a rib and two femurs. Each slice, no wider than a millimeter, was dissolved in nitric acid.\n\nThe resulting solution contained trace amounts of uranium and thorium, which Paces extracted. After measuring those concentrates in a mass spectrometer, Paces concluded that the bones were 130,700 years old, plus or minus 9,400 years. The specificity was stunning.\n\n\"How could this be wrong?\" Paces asked himself.\n\nHolen and Demere sent three of the cobblestones to Richard Fulagar, an archaeologist at the University of Wollongong in Australia. With a variety of microscopes, Fulagar documented the topography of the stones, their abrasions, scratches, scars, polish and pitting.\n\nThere was no mistaking it in Fulagar's view: They had been used as hammers and anvils.\n\nGeorge Jefferson, who had advised Demere to \"keep it under wraps,\" was invited for his experience in taphonomy, the science of what happens to an animal from the time it dies to the time it is dug up.\n\n\"Each new test,\" he said, \"supported the claim.\"\n\nThe conclusion seemed clear: Hominids, wandering through Southern California, had found a mastodon carcass and gone to work. They hauled cobblestones to the site and pounded the bones, cut out the marrow for food and broke off splinters for tools.\n\nIt was, Demere says, \"a Pleistocene MacGyver moment,\" making things out of common objects.\n\nTo signify the spot, Demere speculates, the hominids may have driven that tusk into the ground as a landmark.\n\nKathleen Holen wrote the first draft of their findings, and then fielded comments from the 10 co-authors through 35 versions.\n\nSteve Holen and Demere decided to submit their findings to the scientific journal Nature. They thought that the London-based publication would be more open to their interpretation of the site than a journal in the United States. Conclusions such as theirs were more easily accepted in Europe, where sites like this were more common.\n\nThe group decided to honor Cerutti, who had stopped the excavator that Monday morning in 1992 and made, to their reckoning, one of the most important discoveries in American archaeology.\n\nThey called the excavation the Cerutti Mastodon Site.\n\nAfter three rounds of review by four \"referees\u2014three archaeologists and one geochronologist\u2014over a course of a year, Nature accepted the article: 1,700 words, 24 site drawings, eight videos and 71 pages of supplemental material.\n\nThe article was published in April 2017 and went viral. Its findings landed on the front pages of newspapers and led many websites.\n\nDissent from some of the world's most distinguished archaeologists was immediate.\n\nBriana Pobiner damned the work with faint praise. She told Smithsonian magazine, \"I think the combination of evidence is on the way to being convincing.\"\n\nOthers didn't hold back.\n\nDonald Grayson to BuzzFeed News: \"I was astonished, not because it is so good but because it is so bad.\"\n\nDavid Meltzer to the Guardian: \"I'm not buying what's being sold.\"\n\nNational Geographic pronounced its skepticism in an article titled \"Humans in California 130,000 Years Ago? Get the Facts.\"\n\nThe article drew scathing opinions by Tom Dillehay and Jim Adovasio. They had been the lead archaeologists on sites in the New World\u2014Dillehay in Chile and Adovasio in Pennsylvania\u2014that after years of controversy had earned acceptance for their own pre-Clovis claims.\n\nThe research at the Cerutti site, Dillehay said, doesn't rule out the possibility that a debris or mudflow carried the cobblestones to the scene, nor does it take into account that patterns on the stones might have been caused by the rocks bumping against one another in a fast-flowing river.\n\n\"When you put the total package together,\" he said, \"there's certainly more evidence to reject than accept it.\"\n\nAdovasio said: \"They make a statement that the (evidence at Cerutti) is consistent with many other sites.... Well, I'm sorry, it's not\u2014that just isn't simply true.\"\n\nIn a response co-written with nine colleagues and drafted as a rebuttal for publication in Nature, Todd Braje, a professor of archaeology at San Diego State University, said Holen, Demere and their dream team did not go far enough to rule out other possible causes for the spiral fractures and broken bones.\n\n\"Because humans could have fractured the CML mastodon remains does not mean they did fracture them,\" they wrote.\n\nBraje and his co-authors said the bones might have been trampled, for example by other large animals. He also found it suspicious that there were no \"unambiguous chipped-stone tools.\"\n\nEven though Nature declined to publish Braje's letter, he found a place for it in another journal, which had already accepted two other commentaries, including one by Gary Haynes, emeritus professor of anthropology at the University of Nevada, Reno.\n\nThe bones could have been damaged and the cobblestones scattered by earthmoving equipment used by the Transportation Department in 1992, or by the developer who created the adjacent subdivision in 1971, Haynes said.\n\nEven while saying the claim was \"minimally plausible,\" he called it \"an argument from ignorance,\" and wrote that the \"archaeologists have clearly not been trained.\"\n\n\"It was like getting lined up and shot with machine guns,\" Cerutti said.\n\nHaynes was also critical of Nature, accusing the journal of committing \"an editorial lapse in judgment\" by accepting the Holen-Demere package.\n\nA Nature spokeswoman said the journal does not comment on its editorial or review process, and that dissenting opinions are published only after the arguments have been peer-reviewed.\n\nDemere and Holen maintain that their article does address the alternative theories, and accuse skeptics of being more rhetorical than constructive by requiring them to rule out explanations that no one articulated.\n\n\"A spaceship smashing into the site?\" Demere said.\n\nThe challenge facing the Cerutti team is not just the site itself but all the questions that it raises about man's migration out of Africa, said John McNabb, a senior lecturer in Paleolithic Archaeology at the University of Southampton, who was invited by Nature to review the letter before publication.\n\nWho were these people breaking these bones? At least three species of hominids populated Earth at that time: Homo sapiens, Neanderthals and Denisovans.\n\nAnd how did they get to North America? What was the condition of the land bridge between Siberia and Alaska that long ago? What were the sea levels like? How cold might it have been?\n\nOr did they come by watercraft?\n\nAnd what became of them?\n\nMcNabb understands why archaeologists are eager to dismiss the claims of the Cerutti Mastodon Site. But attributing their objections entirely to ego is too easy and only perpetuates the personal rivalries that have dogged this topic for decades.\n\n\"Entrenched views are hard to shift for researchers who have built a reputation on them,\" he said.\n\nThough skeptical of the Cerutti team's findings, McNabb argues that the burden is now on archaeologists to visit the collection, study the data and arrive at their own conclusions.\n\n\"It is these folks who should now be looking at the site and remains\u2014independent researchers, outside the arguments, who could bring skill and expertise to bear on these questions,\" he said.\n\nDemere and Holen have invited researchers to examine their data and the specimens. But no one has done so, as if to study their work would be to dignify it.\n\nUntil then, said Kathleen Holen, \"we intend to continue to search for similar sites and hope our findings will inspire future archaeologists to do the same.\"\n\nToday, Richard Cerutti and his wife live in an apartment in Imperial Beach. His living room is a museum to a lifetime spent as a field paleontologist: a bookshelf covered with rocks that he has knapped, boxes of folders and books\u2014and 33 buckets filled with artifacts.\n\n\"We're scientists,\" he said, \"and we want to know our own history. Who were the first Americans? When did they get here? How did they get here?\"\n\nThirteen miles away, a mastodon bearing his name resides in Room 359 of the San Diego Natural History Museum, locked in cabinets kept at 67 degrees. It is the great puzzle of Cerutti's lifetime\u2014and of the New World.\n\nThomas Kuhn, the scientist-philosopher who wrote \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,\" said \"normal science\" dominates discourse until anomalies arise that normal science can no longer address. The result is a shift in thinking that ushers in a new era of understanding.\n\nDemere and Holen think the study of early man in the New World has reached this point.\n\nRichard Cerutti is betting on it.\n\nExplore further: Humans in America '115,000 years earlier than thought'", "title": "An ancient mastodon ignited a debate over humans' arrival in North America"}], "occurence_date": "26 Apr 2008", "occurence_timestamp": 1209192010453, "magnitude": 5.1, "actual_city": "Mogul, Nevada"}, {"news": [{"url": "https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Earthquake-LA-Magnitude-250603231.html", "content": "After a magnitude-4.4 struck Los Angeles early Monday morning, officials are working on an earthquake warning system.

After 24 hours, she said, that chance will drop to 1 percent.\n\n\"Every earthquake relieves some stress,\" Hutton said. \"It's usually only a drop in the ocean. In other words, the amount of stress released by this earthquake is minuscule compared to the amount that's built up and is building up for the Big One when it happens some day in the future.\" Watch Hutton say Tuesday's quake was a sign of bigger ones to come \u00bb\n\nAnd when will that be?\n\n\"From a geologist's point of view, the answer has to be soon,\" she said. \"But geologists are used to thinking on millions of years and thousands of years time scale, so I don't think that gives any useful information for people, except be prepared at any time because it could happen at any time.\"\n\nA 5.4 magnitude quake is considered by the USGS to be \"moderate,\" which can cause slight damage to buildings and others structures. So far this year, 39 \"moderate\" earthquakes of between magnitude 5.0 and 5.9 have occurred in the United States, and 790 globally.\n\nThe last moderate quake to strike California was a magnitude 5.4 in April in the northern part of the state.

Arnold Schwarzenegger. \"We were very fortunate that there were no serious injuries or property damage.\"\n\nHe said he believes the state is \"as prepared as anyone can be. We have continuous discussions about that. We are fanatics about emergencies and to be ready.\"\n\nThe largest earthquake in recent years in California was a magnitude 7.1 in 1999, Hutton said. But it was centered in the desert, near Twentynine Palms, in a sparsely populated area.\n\nTuesday's quake struck about 11:42 a.m., according to the USGS. Its epicenter was about 2 miles southwest of Chino Hills and about 5 miles southeast of Diamond Bar.\n\nThe epicenter was about 7.6 miles deep, making it a fairly shallow quake, according to CNN meteorologist Chad Meyers. In general, earthquakes centered closer to the surface produce stronger shaking and can cause more damage than those further underground. But most Southern California earthquakes tend to be fairly shallow, officials said.\n\nMore than 30 aftershocks were recorded. Hutton said the largest was a magnitude 3.6.\n\nLos Angeles police said a downtown hotel sustained some structural damage, but no one was injured and the building was not evacuated. There were some unconfirmed reports of minor injuries. The White House was also monitoring the situation, said spokeswoman Dana Perino.\n\nDespite the absence of serious damage or injuries, some Los Angeles-area residents were left rattled. The quake was felt as far south as San Diego, California, and the USGS said it received reports of light shaking as far north as Rosamond, California, about 55 miles north-northeast of Los Angeles.\n\nReports from those who felt the quake poured into CNN. Did you feel the quake?\n\n\"My house was like a fun house. Everything was moving,\" said Danny Casler, 28, of Huntington Beach. He said he was sleeping when his house began shaking, and some things fell in the living room. He said he ran out of the house in his boxer shorts.\n\nAttorney Kevin Crisp said he was on the phone with his law partner in Riverside, 65 miles away, who burst out, \"Big quake!\" Crisp said he felt it about five seconds later. \"This was very impressive. Long and very uniform. Really had the building going.\" He said doors were swinging on the hinges and bottles of wine were rolling back and forth on his shelf.\n\n\"It just started with a really strong jolt,\" said Wendy Criner. \"I ran and got my daughters from different rooms, and we squatted in the living room. I did have stuff fall off the shelf, some books in my daughters' room and some things in the kitchen.\"\n\nThe quake knocked out a ground radar system at Los Angeles International Airport, but that has not interfered with operations, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Technicians were working to restore the system, which helps controllers monitor traffic on the ground. Also, tiles fell from the ceiling in one terminal as water flowed from a burst pipe.\n\nThe calculation of the quake's magnitude fluctuated as seismologists reviewed the data. Initially classified as a magnitude 5.8, the quake's intensity was reduced to a 5.6 and then to a 5.4. Because the earthquake magnitude scale is exponential, a 5.8 magnitude quake is four to five times more intense than a 5.4.\n\nTwo nuclear plants are in the vicinity of the quake's epicenter near Chino Hills, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The closest to the epicenter is in San Onofre, 50 miles south, but an NRC spokesman said, \"this is well below the threshold for any conceivable damage to the plants.\"\n\n\"In the U.S. particularly in California, buildings are generally built well enough that it takes about a 5.5 for there to be some damage, so we do have the potential for damage,\" said Don Blakeman, an analyst for the USGS. \"It depends on the structures [and] the ground the building is built on.\"\n\nHe said he would expect objects to be knocked from shelves and some windows broken. \"It's kind of on the margin where you'll get some structural damage from these. We may find that some of the older homes and buildings that weren't retrofitted suffer more damage than the newer structures.\n\n\"I would expect some cracked buildings,\" he said. \"There is the potential for injuries, but hopefully we won't have too much of that.\"\n\nBlakeman's comments came before the quake's magnitude was dropped to a 5.4. However, he said afterward that the change does not affect his expectations, although obviously there is less potential for damage.\n\nStill, the quake jolted the nerves of many Californians.\n\n\"I've lived in California, I've lived through several of them,\" Margot Wagner of Santa Barbara told CNN. \"It's always a little unnerving.\"\n\nCopyright 2008 CNN.

Britain's biggest earthquake in seven years has hit Kent. It was a magnitude of 4.2, shacking windows and causing walls to creak when it struck 1.4 miles off the coast near Ramsgate at 2.52am.\n\nNo injuries or damage to buildings were reported following the tremor, but locals reported books being shaken from shelves and described the earthquake as feeling like a vehicle had been driven into their property.\n\nMore than 800 \"felt reports\" were received by the British Geological Survey (BGS), mainly from residents in Ramsgate, Margate and surrounding areas. But the BGS said reports of the earthquake were also received from as far afield as Norwich, North Walsham and Cromer in East Anglia.\n\nGraph from a British Geological Survey monitoring station showing the Kent earthquake measuring magnitude 4.2\n\n10.20\n\nMore Telegraph readers have been in touch with their stories of feeling this morning's Kent earthquake. Here are some of them:\n\nStella Hulott, Westgate on Sea:\n\nThe only way I can describe it is like when you drink too much and wake up in the night with the room moving and feeling disorientated!\n\nThe room was rocking side to side, it was a very weird, frightening experience. I also heard a rumble, a groan sort of, and the neighbour's dogs started barking and I could hear the seagulls madly squawking.\n\nMy cats jumped off the bed and looked very worried. I went on social media to make sure it wasn't all just a dream wondering whether there had been a bomb, a plane crashing nearby or something else!\n\nI then rang my dad who is local and he said the window started tapping then his bed shook. It was truly terrifying and, until I got affirmation on social media that it was indeed a tremor, it was very frightening.\n\nPaul and Janette, Worsfold:\n\nMy wife and I jumped out of bed at 2 50 as our flat in Deal began to shake quite violently. Indeed it shook enough for the porcelain figurines on bathroom windowsill to crash into the bath and break.\n\nDr Joe Hunter, Chestfield:\n\nOur bedroom shutters rattled for 3 - 4 seconds - rather alarming!\n\n10.00\n\nThe 4.2 magnitude earthquake might have been the biggest to hit Britain in seven years, but the fact the epicentre was 1.4 miles off the Kent coast meant the county escaped physical damage - but it will bring back memories for some.\n\nA 4.3 magnitude quake - which lasted for two minutes - hit Folkestone at 8.19am on April 28, 2007, leaving the Garden of England with widespread damage.\n\nA series of shocks left residents fearing a massive gas blast or terrorist atrocity. The reality was more prosaic, if equally unexpected: the largest earthquake in Britain for five years causing damage that ran into tens of millions of pounds.\n\nDamage in Folkestone after the April 2007 earthquake\n\n09.40\n\nThe Kent earthquake early today is the biggest to hit Britain in seven years since a 5.2 magnitude quake struck Market Rasen, in Lincolnshire, on February 27, 2008.\n\nBut where else have relatively big earthquakes occurred in the UK in the last eight years?

Here are a few of them:\n\nElizabeth Leonard, Deal:\n\nI woke with a shock at 2.50am as the house was shuddering loudly and violently. Even the plantation blinds in my son's room were rattling. I had no idea what it was until I saw the news this morning. It gave me a tremendous shock but my son didn't stir!\n\nJo Petite:\n\nThe whole house shook. I woke my partner and said that there had been an earth tremor. I checked the time, it was 02.56. He got up to make tea; he thought I was mistaken and that a burglar had climbed onto the scaffolding.\n\nWill Mosedale, University of Kent student:\n\nWoke up thinking that exam stress had got the better of me and that I was shaking, then I realised that the rest of the room was shaking too and thought it was a strange dream. Luckily I got a call in morning asking if I felt the earthquake and now I feel a little less mad.\n\nKeeley Brady, Hullbridge, Essex:\n\nI heard a loud crack at first, then the house shook for about 20 seconds. My daughter said she was woken up and her clothes hangers rattling on the door handle, but because we watched the Enfield Haunting before bed, we were both scared to get up.\n\nClive Mannering, Sittingbourne:\n\nI was woken with a start by the tremor at 02.50ish this morning, felt our bed shaking and bedroom door rattling which was accompanied by what sounded like a distant thunder rumble. It lasted probably less than 10 seconds, but was pretty scary to be woken in such a way and I lay awake for nearly two hours wondering if I'd imagined it but was convinced I hadn't more so because of the door rattling.\n\n08.45\n\nDoes the fact Britain has experienced a 4.2 magnitude earthquake this morning mean we are more likely to feel more? Well, maybe.\n\nThe British Geological Survey said there \"could be more tremors\" following the quake, which it described as \"quite significant\" and was the biggest felt in Britain for seven years.\n\nHowever, a spokesman told BBC Radio Kent: \"Not all earthquakes have aftershocks. Most of the energy could have been released in this one earthquake and the next one might not be for another three, four, five or 10 years. We can't predict.\"\n\n08.30\n\nExperts said it was difficult to link this morning's earthquake to a specific fault line.\n\nDavid Galloway, a seismologist with the British Geological Survey, said: \"The whole of the UK is criss-crossed by thousands of fault lines but most of them are at depth.\n\n\"This means we do not pinpoint a specific earthquake to a specific fault because even if a location is a few hundred metres off it could have been a completely different fault.\n\n\"Fortunately we do not live on the plate edges - for example the San Andreas fault in California can actually be seen at the surface, but the faults in the UK are blind and most earthquakes happen at a depth of between 5km and 25km.\n\n\"Earthquakes happen all over the UK - we get some 200 a year on average. One of the scale of this morning's only happen every two or three years.\"\n\n08.20\n\nThe great British sense of humour has been in no shortage of supply this morning. Social media users were quick to make light of the quake, jokingly posting \"devastating scenes\" of overturned wheelie bins and garden furniture with messages such as \"We will rebuild\".\n\nLive scenes in Kent after they had a catastrophic earthquake! pic.twitter.com/j8FzrxSXSU \u2014 Dean Martin (@Dean_Martin5) May 22, 2015\n\nNo matter how much inconvenience the #KentEarthquake has caused....us kentonians will troop on x pic.twitter.com/WUfdA45C9k \u2014 IAMEatonsMess x (@Britishchickx) May 22, 2015\n\nApparently #Kent had an #earthquake last night.

Graham Johnson, who lives in Bedworth, Warwickshire, has been in touch to say he was woken up at the time of the quake by all his landline phones ringing continuously - then going completely dead. He lost his internet connection, too. Has anyone else had that problem?\n\n08.00\n\nSusan Fry, who lives in Ramsgate near the epicentre of the quake, said she felt a \"strange rumbling sound\" at just before 3am.\n\nAt 2.53am, we were woken up by the house shaking for about 10 seconds. We instantly knew it was an earthquake. There was a strange rumbling sound. The vibrations felt like being on cruise ship when it comes onto port sideways.\n\nAnd Barry Hunt, who lives in Faversham, reports:\n\nI was woken by a short graunching shudder. It felt like someone had slammed a sticking door very hard.\n\n07.50\n\nThe moment the earthquake hit was captured by the instruments on the Tempest gas turbine at the Discovery Park, in Sandwich.\n\nChris Hill, from Inspired Control Engineering, said although the engine was not running at the time data clearly showed the vibration.\n\nVibrations picked up at the Tempest gas turbine at the Discovery Park in Sandwich (Inspired Control Engineering)\n\n07.40\n\nThe earthquake overnight measured magnitude 4.2 on the Richter scale, the largest recorded in Britain since 2007. But what does the magnitude scale actually mean?\n\nLess than 3.5: Generally not felt, but recorded by earthquake monitoring equipment.\n\n3.5 to 5.4: Often felt, but rarely causes damage.\n\nUnder 6.0 At most, slight damage to well-designed buildings.

Can cause serious damage in areas several hundred kilometres across.\n\n07.30\n\nReader Pauline Field, who lives in Borden, near Sittingbourne, has been in touch:\n\nThe whole house and the wall behind my bed shook. I thought a large animal was on the roof. Didn't sleep for ages after.\n\nAnother reader, John MacAlister, said he believed he could feel the earthquake across the Channel in Normandy.\n\nDid you feel the earthquake? Email danny.boyle@telegraph.co.uk.\n\n07.20\n\nOf those surveyed shortly after the earthquake, two-thirds reported that their windows rattled and one-third said their furniture shook. The BGS listed quotes from people who took part in the survey:\n\n\u201cThought door to hotel was being kicked in, woke up alarmed\u201d\n\n\u201cWoke the whole household and neighbours with a bang that lasted 1-2 seconds\u201d\n\n\"Walls of house creaked, sounded like heavy object rolling over roof of the house\u201d\n\n\u201cNoise and the whole building just shaking.

Cars and construction thrived in the roaring 1920s, and solid jobs in both industries helped lift wages and consumption. Ford was making 9,000 of its Model T cars a day, and spending on new-build homes hit $5 billion in 1925. There were bumps along the way (1923 and 1926 saw slowdowns) but momentum was strong.\n\nBanks looked good, too. By 1929 the combined balance-sheets of America\u2019s 25,000 lenders stood at $60 billion. The assets they held seemed prudent: just 60% were loans, with 15% held as cash. Even the 20% made up by investment securities seemed sensible: the lion\u2019s share of holdings were bonds, with ultra-safe government bonds making up more than half. With assets of such high quality the banks allowed the capital buffers that protected them from losses to dwindle.\n\nBut as the 1920s wore on the young Federal Reserve faced a conundrum: share prices and prices in the shops started to move in opposite directions. Markets were booming, with the shares of firms exploiting new technologies\u2014radios, aluminium and aeroplanes\u2014particularly popular. But few of these new outfits had any record of dividend payments, and investors piled into their shares in the hope that they would continue to increase in value. At the same time established businesses were looking weaker as consumer prices fell. For a time the puzzle\u2014whether to raise rates to slow markets, or cut them to help the economy\u2014paralysed the Fed. In the end the market-watchers won and the central bank raised rates in 1928.\n\nIt was a catastrophic error. The increase, from 3.5% to 5%, was too small to blunt the market rally: share prices soared until September 1929, with the Dow Jones index hitting a high of 381. But it hurt America\u2019s flagging industries. By late summer industrial production was falling at an annualised rate of 45%. Adding to the domestic woes came bad news from abroad. In September the London Stock Exchange crashed when Clarence Hatry, a fraudulent financier, was arrested. A sell-off was coming. It was huge: over just two days, October 28th and 29th, the Dow lost close to 25%. By November 13th it was at 198, down 45% in two months.\n\nWorse was to come. Bank failures came in waves. The first, in 1930, began with bank runs in agricultural states such as Arkansas, Illinois and Missouri. A total of 1,350 banks failed that year. Then a second wave hit Chicago, Cleveland and Philadelphia in April 1931. External pressure worsened the domestic worries. As Britain dumped the Gold Standard its exchange rate dropped, putting pressure on American exporters. There were banking panics in Austria and Germany. As public confidence evaporated, Americans again began to hoard currency. A bond-buying campaign by the Federal Reserve brought only temporary respite, because the surviving banks were in such bad shape.\n\nThis became clear in February 1933. A final panic, this time national, began to force more emergency bank holidays, with lenders in Nevada, Iowa, Louisiana and Michigan the first to shut their doors. The inland banks called in inter-bank deposits placed with New York lenders, stripping them of $760m in February 1933 alone. Naturally the city bankers turned to their new backstop, the Federal Reserve. But the unthinkable happened. On March 4th the central bank did exactly what it had been set up to prevent. It refused to lend and shut its doors. In its mission to act as a source of funds in all emergencies, the Federal Reserve had failed. A week-long bank holiday was called across the nation.\n\nIt was the blackest week in the darkest period of American finance. Regulators examined banks\u2019 books, and more than 2,000 banks that closed that week never opened again. After this low, things started to improve. Nearly 11,000 banks had failed between 1929 and 1933, and the money supply dropped by over 30%. Unemployment, just 3.2% on the eve of the crisis, rose to more than 25%; it would not return to its previous lows until the early 1940s. It took more than 25 years for the Dow to reclaim its peak in 1929.\n\nReform was clearly needed. The first step was to de-risk the system. In the short term this was done through a massive injection of publicly supplied capital. The $1 billion boost\u2014a third of the system\u2019s existing equity\u2014went to more than 6,000 of the remaining 14,000 banks. Future risks were to be neutralised by new legislation, the Glass-Steagall rules that separated stockmarket operations from more mundane lending and gave the Fed new powers to regulate banks whose customers used credit for investment.\n\nA new government body was set up to deal with bank runs once and for all: the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC), established on January 1st 1934. By protecting $2,500 of deposits per customer it aimed to reduce the costs of bank failure. Limiting depositor losses would protect income, the money supply and buying power. And because depositors could trust the FDIC, they would not queue up at banks at the slightest financial wobble.\n\nIn a way, it worked brilliantly. Banks quickly started advertising the fact that they were FDIC insured, and customers came to see deposits as risk-free. For 70 years, bank runs became a thing of the past. Banks were able to reduce costly liquidity and equity buffers, which fell year on year. An inefficient system of self-insurance fell away, replaced by low-cost risk-sharing, with central banks and deposit insurance as the backstop.\n\nYet this was not at all what Hamilton had hoped for. He wanted a financial system that made government more stable, and banks and markets that supported public debt to allow infrastructure and military spending at low rates of interest. By 1934 the opposite system had been created: it was now the state\u2019s job to ensure that the financial system was stable, rather than vice versa. By loading risk onto the taxpayer, the evolution of finance had created a distorting subsidy at the heart of capitalism.\n\nThe recent fate of the largest banks in America and Britain shows the true cost of these subsidies. In 2008 Citigroup and RBS Group were enormous, with combined assets of nearly $6 trillion, greater than the combined GDP of the world\u2019s 150 smallest countries. Their capital buffers were tiny. When they ran out of capital, the bail-out ran to over $100 billion. The overall cost of the banking crisis is even greater\u2014in the form of slower growth, higher debt and poorer employment prospects that may last decades in some countries.\n\nBut the bail-outs were not a mistake: letting banks of this size fail would have been even more costly. The problem is not what the state does, but that its hand is forced. Knowing that governments must bail out banks means parts of finance have become a one-way bet. Banks\u2019 debt is a prime example. The IMF recently estimated that the world\u2019s largest banks benefited from implicit government subsidies worth a total of $630 billion in the year 2011-12. This makes debt cheap, and promotes leverage. In America, meanwhile, there are proposals for the government to act as a backstop for the mortgage market, covering 90% of losses in a crisis. Again, this pins risk on the public purse. It is the same old pattern.\n\nTo solve this problem means putting risk back into the private sector. That will require tough choices. Removing the subsidies banks enjoy will make their debt more expensive, meaning equity holders will lose out on dividends and the cost of credit could rise. Cutting excessive deposit insurance means credulous investors who put their nest-eggs into dodgy banks could see big losses.\n\nAs regulators implement a new round of reforms in the wake of the latest crisis, they have an opportunity to reverse the trend towards ever-greater entrenchment of the state\u2019s role in finance. But weaning the industry off government support will not be easy. As the stories of these crises show, hundreds of years of financial history have been pushing in the other direction.", "title": "Financial crises"}, {"url": "http://archive.kitsapsun.com/news/local/the-business-of-golf--kitsap-courses-land-in-the-recessionary-rough-ep-419670019-357606291.html/", "content": "A Port Ludlow assistant golf pro Darren Posey on the trail nine closed course with the tall grass. Larry Steagall | Kitsap Sun\n\nBy Jeff Graham of the Kitsap Sun\n\nPort Ludlow\n\nVito DeSantis fell in love with Port Ludlow Golf Club's Trail Nine after being hired as the club's director two years ago.\n\nWhenever DeSantis wanted to steal away from work, he could hop in a golf cart, zoom past the driving range and spend two hours teeing it up among old-growth trees, wildflowers and wildlife.\n\nIt didn't get much better than the second hole, where Mount Baker and Ludlow Bay kiss the horizon. Esquire Magazine once called it one of the most scenic holes in the world.\n\nToo bad no one has stepped foot on the course in more than a year.\n\n\"From the driving range, you look out there, it looks playable,\" DeSantis said. \"I could go out there right now and throw down some balls and actually play. It would be like a goat ranch, but I could play.\"\n\nTrail Nine ? which opened in 1992 to join the club's Tide and Timber nines ? closed indefinitely last May amid economic concerns.\n\nDeSantis said the only attention it gets now is from the occasional lawn mower, and that's so nearby homeowners don't complain about tall grass.\n\nSuch is life now as a golf-course operator. Across the nation, public and private clubs are dealing with too many local competitors, not enough golfers and an economy on wobbly legs.\n\nSome clubs are closing. Others are trying to stay afloat, and operators are wondering how the industry got into such a fragile state.\n\nIt's the same story locally. The explosion of new courses on the Olympic Peninsula the past two decades has left operators struggling to fill tee sheets as they trim budgets, reduce staff and hope for sunshine and more golfers.\n\nWhen will things get better?\n\n\"I can't imagine it getting a whole lot worse,\" said Scott Alexander, director of golf operations at Bremerton's Gold Mountain Golf Complex.\n\nIF YOU BUILD IT ...\n\nPaul Ramsdell remembers what it was like to be a golfer in the region in the late 1980s. Ramsdell, former general manager at Kitsap Golf & Country Club in Bremerton, said he'd call clubs trying to get an early-morning tee time, only to be treated like a comedian.\n\n\"They'd laugh at you,\" Ramsdell said.\n\nAt the time, the Olympic Peninsula had a dozen public facilities and more than enough people who wanted to play.\n\n\"It put huge pressure on those golf courses,\" said Shawn Cucciardi, general manager of Port Orchard's McCormick Woods Golf Course, which opened in 1988. \"The courses were slow. It was hard to get a tee time. So people were frustrated by it. That's why they would leave public golf and go join a country club.\"\n\nEven people who could afford to pay initiation fees and monthly membership dues at country clubs ? all seven on the Peninsula opened before 1989 ? found gaining entry tough. Ramsdell, who joined private Fircrest Golf Club in Tacoma in 1989, said it took four years and $7,500 to become a full member \"because there was such a waiting list.\"\n\nThen the 1990s hit. The economy was ? as Cucciardi put it ? \"rocking and rolling.\" Course design was in fashion and there was plenty of land ready to be sculpted.\n\nSuddenly golf courses were popping up in every corner of the country.\n\nAccording to the National Golf Foundation, of the 11,581 public golf facilities in the U.S. today, 30 percent opened after 1990. Many were high-end courses or real-estate courses, built to help sell homes and lots.\n\nIn Washington alone, 76 of the 287 courses in the state were built in the last two decades.\n\nLocally, Horseshoe Lake opened in Port Orchard in 1992. In 1996, the Olympic Course debuted at Gold Mountain. A year later, Discovery Bay in Port Townsend added nine holes.\n\nThe decade concluded with 36 more holes being built: the Generation II and III nines at LakeLand Village opened in Allyn in 1998, while Trophy Lake Golf & Casting began play in 1999.\n\nThe two most recent openings were the 9-hole, links-style SkyRidge Golf Course in Sequim (2003) and White Horse Golf Club in Kingston (2007).\n\nTedd Hudanich, golf pro at Rolling Hills Golf Club in Bremerton, said the popular phrase from the movie \"Field of Dreams\" describes the prevailing thought of course-builders during 1990s: \"If you build it, they will come.\"\n\nOnly somebody forgot to say when enough was enough.\n\n\"It just got out of control,\" Cucciardi said. \"They simply built too many golf courses.\"\n\nSUPPLY AND DEMAND\n\nTo find out how golf clubs are faring today, just pick up the phone, Cucciardi said, and ask for a tee time ? any tee time.\n\nWhile golf courses were being added all over the country, the number of golfers wasn't changing significantly. There were 28.6 million golfers in the country in 2008, according to the NGF. That's fewer golfers than in 2000 (28.8 million) and only slightly more than in 1990 (27.4 million).\n\n\"If you had a million golfers in Puget Sound and 20 golf courses, all of a sudden you have the same number of golfers and 40 courses ? do the math,\" Cucciardi said.\n\n\"We're all going after the same guy,\" DeSantis said.\n\nHudanich, who has worked at Rolling Hills since 1978, said his club averaged more than 50,000 rounds per year in the late 1980s. The number dipped below 40,000 rounds in 2006, before rebounding slightly in the past few years.\n\n\"The addition of golf courses is what ate into our play,\" Hudanich said.\n\nGold Mountain averaged 111,115 players at its Cascade and Olympic Courses between 1997 and 1999. From 2007 to 2009, both courses drew an average of 85,618 players per year.\n\n\"It's a struggle,\" said Alexander, adding that Gold Mountain has fought to break even financially in recent years. \"The golf course used to make money.\"\n\nToo many golf courses isn't the only challenge. Retail sales have taken a big hit since the economy went sour.\n\nWith less disposable income, golfers aren't as willing to buy the new $300 driver at the pro shop.\n\n\"They are not buying the $80 golf shirt, the 12 golf balls,\" DeSantis said. \"They are looking for golf balls (on the course), that's what my members are doing. My members' golf gloves are falling off their fingers.\"\n\nCourses like Port Ludlow that are tied to residential properties have also been limited by the recession.\n\n\"If homes aren't selling, new members aren't being introduced,\" DeSantis said.\n\nThe club at present has 250 members, but that number needs to climb north of 300 before it will consider re-opening the Trail Nine.\n\n\"If home sales come back and membership continues to grow, we'll think about re-opening it,\" he said.\n\nThe unpredictable weather in the Pacific Northwest also affects the number of rounds played on a monthly basis.\n\nJim Dunwiddie, Kitsap Parks and Recreation director, said county-operated Village Greens Golf Course in Port Orchard did well in April, up 20 percent in rounds played from the previous year.\n\nThen the rains and cooler temperatures came in May and play suffered.\n\n\"Everything is related to weather,\" Dunwiddie said.\n\nWHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS\n\nWhen golfers have problems with their swing, they go to the range or take a lesson and get things figured out.\n\nGolf course operators face a much more arduous task in trying to turn the industry around.\n\n\"I do not see things getting better quickly,\" Alexander said.\n\nClubs, however, have come up with some ways to get things headed in the right direction.\n\nTwo years ago, before the recession began to hit the country in full force, clubs like McCormick Woods began limiting expenses. The club trimmed its working staff and employees accepted pay cuts and took reduced hours.\n\n\"Thankfully for us, we didn't wait to see what the impact was going to be,\" Cucciardi said. \"We were proactive versus reactive.\"\n\nPrivate clubs like Wing Point Golf & Country Club on Bainbridge Island cut initiation fees from $25,000 to as low as $7,500. Others like Kitsap Golf & Country Club waived initiation fees altogether.\n\n\"Some of the clubs stubbornly decided that their price was their price,\" said Nick West, Wing Point general manager. \"They didn't realize that everyone was going to become more value-oriented.\"\n\nWhite Horse also lowered its greens fees to become more comparable with other Kitsap-area courses. Most cost between $30-40 on weekdays and $50-60 on weekends during the summer, making the area quite a consumer's market.\n\n\"We have very affordable golf courses over here,\" said Patricia Graf-Hoke, executive general manager of the Kitsap Peninsula Visitor & Convention Bureau, which recently launched a new website featuring the area's top clubs.\n\nFinding ways to get existing players on the course more and getting new players into the game are the top objectives.\n\nThe Kitsap Golf Group ? a partnership between Gold Mountain, McCormick Woods and Trophy Lake ? formed six years ago with the goal of bringing existing players into the area with stay-and-play packages.\n\nFor $349, a golfer can stay at the Silverdale Beach Hotel or the Hampton Inn & Suites in Bremerton and play all three courses.\n\n\"You go down to California, one round at a decent course will run you 200 bucks,\" Cucciardi said.\n\nBy working together, the KGG is able to accomplish what Discovery Bay designer Mike Asmundson described as \"synergy\" between area clubs.\n\n\"As an individual, I'm not a destination,\" Cucciardi said. \"Golfers in Canada, they are not going to come down and play McCormick Woods for four days. You know what they will do? Come down and play here for a day, Trophy a day, Gold Mountain a day. Now we're a destination.\"\n\nThe group ? which makes its presence known at golf shows all over the West Coast ? generated $375,000 in revenue last year.\n\n\"We try to drive more golf to Kitsap as a whole,\" Cucciardi said.\n\nPutting golf clubs in the hands of more young players is also a point of emphasis at many area courses.\n\nOki Golf, which owns Trophy Lake and 10 other properties in the state, recently began offering a junior players club card, which allows youth to play at any of its courses for a fraction of the cost ? as low as $10-25.\n\n\"Not every mom and dad can afford to play 50 bucks to go have their kid play,\" said David Vladyka, director of marketing at Oki Golf.\n\nMany courses hold junior clinics during the playing season. McCormick Woods is home to the Northwest Junior Golf Tour, which is designed to get kids of all ages and backgrounds into the game. The club runs 19 events a year.\n\n\"We have to grow the game of golf,\" Cucciardi said.\n\nFor golf courses, the feeling is quite the opposite.\n\n\"Everybody would be better off if some courses just went away,\" DeSantis said.\n\nThey are starting to disappear nationally. An average of 125 facilities have closed the past three years, and as many as 150 are expected to close in each of the next few years, according to the NGF.\n\nThere have been three recent closings in the state, said Jeff Shelley, editorial director for golfconstructionnews.com.\n\nHot Springs Golf Course in the southwest Washington town of Carson is closed for business, but may reopen this summer. Holmes Harbor Golf and Beach Club on Whidbey Island ? formerly owned by Seattle SuperSonics legend Jack Sikma, closed in March and is up for sale.\n\nLast December, the nine-hole Links at Olson Mansion in Maple Valley closed.\n\nDon't expect any new courses in Kitsap ? or elsewhere ? any time soon.\n\n\"Anybody that's thinking about opening a golf course,\" Hudanich said, \"is out of their mind.\"\n\nTo read about Gold Mountain's efforts to capitalize on its strong reputation and turn itself into a revenue-generator for the city of Bremerton again, click here.", "title": "Kitsap Courses Land in the Recessionary Rough"}, {"url": "https://www.today.com/popculture/brad-pitt-got-first-gun-kindergarten-doesnt-feel-safe-without-2D80216198", "content": "share tweet pin email\n\nIn his new film, \"Fury,\" Brad Pitt plays Wardaddy, a World War II U.S. tank commander doing bloody battle in Germany.

But prior to 2009, \"terra firma\" in Oklahoma meant just that\u2014earthquakes rarely shook the state.\n\nThen, after decades of seismic quiet where the state averaged less than two quakes of magnitude 3 or greater a year, Oklahoma suddenly saw a sharp uptick, to 20 such quakes in 2009. By 2013 there were 109 such quakes. Since then, the numbers have soared, reaching 903 in 2015 before dipping last year to 623. In the process, Oklahoma has surpassed California to become the most seismically active of the lower 48 U.S. states.\n\nIn 2011, a magnitude 5.7 quake and two related magnitude 5.0 quakes struck near the Oklahoma town of Prague, causing damage and injuries. Then last Sept. 3, a magnitude 5.8 quake struck a few miles northwest of the city of Pawnee, population 2,200. That quake, which occurred on a previously unmapped fault, was the strongest ever measured by instruments in Oklahoma. It shook a large area of north-central Oklahoma and was felt throughout the Midwest and as far away as Phoenix and Pittsburgh.\n\nA Seismic Detective Story, With Satellites\n\nEven before NASA studied the Pawnee earthquake, studies published since late last year by the United States Geological Survey and other institutions suggested that the earthquake was human-induced due to increases in wastewater injection related to petroleum operations. Injection wells place fluids underground into porous geologic formations, which scientsts believe can sometimes enter buried faults that are ready to slip.\n\nTo shed additional light on the source of the Pawnee quake, a team led by geophysicist Eric Fielding of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, used enhanced seismic data and satellite image analysis to more accurately estimate the location and extent of the fault responsible for the quake, its hypocenter (the point below Earth's surface where the quake began) and its aftershocks, and to measure how the fault moved. Results of their study were published recently in Seismological Research Letters.\n\nTo help pinpoint which fault ruptured and where the main quake started, Fielding's team updated the locations of earthquakes published in an Oklahoma Geological Survey catalog of aftershocks. The catalog included nearly 2,200 earthquakes of greater than magnitude 1.0 within about 31 miles (50 kilometers) of the Sept. 3 main shock.\n\nAround Pawnee, the main faults are oriented in a northeast or north direction. But most of the aftershocks to the Sept. 3 quake occurred along a line trending east-southeast from the epicenter. As reported in earlier studies and confirmed by Fielding's team, this told scientists the main shock didn't occur on a previously mapped fault, but on a new fault called the Sooner Lake Fault.\n\nTo determine which parts of the fault slipped in the earthquake, Fielding's team analyzed interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data from the Copernicus Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B satellites operated by the European Space Agency and the McDonald, Dettweiler and Associates Ltd RADARSAT-2 satellite. The team compared InSAR data from multiple satellite overpasses before and after the main shock to create images of ground deformation known as interferograms. The Pawnee earthquake is the first Oklahoma earthquake to be observed using radar satellite data.\n\n\"Radar satellites allow us to study details of earthquakes on faults that were not previously mapped and don't reach the surface,\" Fielding said. \"This allows us to learn more about the processes that cause earthquakes.\"\n\nInterferograms created by the team from the InSAR data showed the ground deformed in a pattern consistent with slip along an east-to-southeast trending fault. The interferograms also showed the quake did not rupture Earth's surface, consistent with field reports.\n\nSeeing the Unseeable: Creating Computer Models of a Buried Fault\n\nFielding's team next input the aftershock and InSAR data into a computer to create models of the fault's likely location and of which parts of the fault slipped during the quake.\n\nTheir preferred model of the Sooner Lake Fault calculates that it dips vertically and is 11 miles (18 kilometers) long and 9 miles (15 kilometers) wide. The model also calculates that the movement on the fault took place deeper than 1.4 miles (2.3 kilometers) beneath the surface, and that the parts that moved the most were located deeper than 2.8 miles (4.5 kilometers). These findings are consistent with a main fault rupture taking place in crystalline basement rock beneath more shallow sedimentary rock layers.\n\nClues Point to a Human-Induced Quake\n\nThe team's results show the main shock began at a depth of about 2.8 miles (4.5 kilometers) below the surface and moved downward to a depth of at least 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) and perhaps as much as 8.7 miles (14 kilometers), into the basement rocks below the sedimentary layer. This downward rupture direction is unusual for natural earthquakes. The fault slipped horizontally about 2 feet (60 centimeters) at a depth of 7.5 miles (12 kilometers).\n\n\"Our results showing a downward fault rupture are consistent with a human-induced earthquake resulting from wastewater injection, rather than a naturally caused quake,\" said Fielding.\n\nFielding said the research may help better manage induced seismicity. \"By understanding how and where earthquakes are induced by wastewater injection, we may be able to mitigate their risk by identifying zones that should be avoided for injection,\" he said.\n\nThe NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission, planned for launch in 2021, may help scientists identify faults responsible for earthquakes and learn more about their causes, both natural and human-induced. It will provide frequent coverage of all land areas twice every 12 days.\n\nExplore further: Oklahoma is laboratory for research on human-induced earthquakes", "title": "Study examines geology of Oklahoma's largest earthquake"}, {"url": "http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-single-payer-backers-keep-up-heat-on-1499114440-htmlstory.html", "content": "Workers prune grapevines at a Napa Valley vineyard.

The most destructive earthquake the U.S. has ever seen was the 7.9-magnitude \u201cGreat San Francisco Earthquake of 1906,\u201d which killed an estimated 3,000 people, according to the agency. As more years have passed without earthquakes, pressure has built up along certain fault lines as tectonic plates try to shift, including in the Pacific Northwest and California, Yeats said.\n\nEarthquakes, which occur when two Earth surfaces move against each other, are typically difficult to predict and impossible to prevent. But the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) maps out high-risk zones based on seismic and geologic data that take into account when and where earthquakes occurred in the past, among other measures that help them predict future events, according to Morgan Moschetti, a USGS research geophysicist. See which areas have the highest potential for an earthquake below.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalifornia is famous for being an earthquake hot zone. As shown on the map above, most of the state and its neighbors to the north carry the highest risk for earthquakes. California, a highly seismically active area, has more than 300 fault lines crossing the state. Particularly at risk is the southern part of the San Andreas fault, which runs close to Los Angeles and has remained quiet since a magnitude 7.9 earthquake in 1857, meaning a lot of pressure has built up along that part of the fault line, Yeats said. According to Moschetti, Southern California, Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area are most at risk in the coming years.\n\nPacific Northwest\n\nThe Pacific Northwest, located along the Cascadia subduction zone, a fault that runs from Vancouver Island to northern California, is bracing itself for an earthquake as pressure has built up in the zone since the 1700s, Yeats said. He said the eventual earthquake could measure at a magnitude of 9, and could be potentially comparable to the San Sixto earthquake, which hit Mexico in 1787 with an estimated magnitude of 8.6.\n\n\u201cThe thickness and size of the plates means that when it finally goes, it is going to cause a very big earthquake,\u201d he said. Yeats said it is impossible to know when the earthquake will occur, but has measured the buildup of strain on the Earth\u2019s crust near the subduction zone.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we just don\u2019t know how to tell when exactly it is. We are certainly envious of people who could predict the eclipse,\u201d he said, referring to the solar eclipse that crossed the sky earlier this year.\n\nOnce the earthquake hits, cities like Seattle and Portland will bear the brunt of the earthquake in body counts because they are more densely populated than the surrounding regions, Moschetti said.\n\nMidwest and South\n\nAway from the coasts and toward the Midwest and southern parts of the U.S. lies the New Madrid Seismic Zone, which puts states including Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana and Arkansas at risk for a destructive earthquake. St. Louis and Memphis have already seen damaging earthquakes in the 1800s, Moschetti says. The New Madrid fault system can also affect Mississippi and Oklahoma \u2014 which, in particular, has seen a rising risk for earthquakes that are induced by human activity, such as drilling for oil and natural gas. Last year, more than 70 earthquakes hit Oklahoma in one week, prompting concerns from state officials about the use of injection wells, which are depositories for drilling byproducts and wastewater. The injected water can alter the friction of natural fault line and cause earthquakes.\n\nAlaska and Hawaii\n\nAlaska, which has an average of 1,000 earthquakes per month, is one of the most seismically active regions in the world, according to the state\u2019s government website: \u201cThe active geology of Alaska guarantees that major damaging earthquakes will continue to occur.\u201d The state had the second-largest earthquake ever recorded in 1964 and has 11% of the world\u2019s recorded earthquakes. According to the state government, seven of the 10 largest earthquakes in the U.S. were in Alaska, and one earthquake with a magnitude of 8 or larger has occurred every 13 years since 1900.\n\nThe USGS says Hawaii experiences thousands of earthquakes each year due to the eruptive forces within its active volcanoes, as well as the weight of the islands causing structural changes beneath the Earth\u2019s crust. While most of the earthquakes are small \u2014 in fact, a 3.7-magnitude quake struck near Kaneohe Station, Hawaii, on Wednesday \u2014 some are large enough to cause damage, the agency says.", "title": "Will a Catastrophic Earthquake Strike the U.S.?"}, {"url": "http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/local_news_from_all_over-spring18/", "content": "Findings\n\nphoto Silke Baron\n\nA Rare Advantage\n\nHere\u2019s one for the \u201csmall is good\u201d category. We usually think species that exist only in small numbers are in danger of going extinct. But apparently, sometimes being rare may hold the ticket to a species\u2019 survival.\n\nWhen most people think of rare species, they think of ones endangered as a result of habitat loss, hunting, poaching, climate change, or other environmental disturbances. But some species have always been rare \u2013 occurring in small densities within their range \u2013 throughout their evolutionary history.\n\nIn a perspective paper published in the journal Ecology Letters , a team of researchers from the University of California, Davis suggests that for many species, such as a Tritonia nudibranch \u2013 a small member of the mollusk family that\u2019s spotted in the Red Sea only once every few years \u2013 rarity is not a guarantee of impending extinction. Instead, the traits that enable some species to be what they term \u201cchronically rare\u201d could very well be an advantage during crises.\n\nThe researchers explored factors that make a species likely to thrive, even if its population is small.\n\nRare species, they found, can persist if fertilization occurs inside or close to an adult, which exponentially increases the chances of the gametes of both sexes actually getting to unite to form a zygote, and of that new life being protected. This might seem obvious, but many species, including sea urchins and abalone, use \u201cbroadcast fertilization,\u201d where they simply release their gametes into the water and hope for the best.\n\nIt also helps if the species is highly mobile, or has help from pollinators or other animal intermediaries that deliver their egg cells and sperm over long distances. It doesn\u2019t hurt if they can also signal and/or attract a mate over a long distance. And if two sexes are combined in a single individual, as is the case with many snails, worms, and some sea stars, all the better!\n\n\u201cDuring great extinction events, almost every species will suffer,\u201d says Geerat Vermeij, a professor with the UC Davis Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, who co-authored the paper. \u201cThe one that can withstand being rare and survive will have a real advantage during extinction events and crises.\u201d\n\nKnowing which traits enable species to be rare could help conservation managers better manage both rare and common species, and better design sanctuaries and preserves on land and at sea. \u201cBy learning how a species can be rare, we can also learn how to protect species that cannot be rare,\u201d Vermeij says.\n\nBut, the paper notes, relatively little is known about rare species. They are notoriously difficult to sample since they are, by definition, uncommon. The researchers bluntly state that there is \u201cvirtually no reliable data to support our predictions\u201d and calls for more research support on this topic.\n\nUp in the Air\n\nTread Lightly in Palau\n\nphoto Adrianna Calvo\n\nThe tiny country of Palau has taken an outsized stance on the environment. Over the past several years, the Pacific island nation has enacted legislation protecting hundreds of marine species, spoken boldly on the need for climate action, and established one of the world\u2019s largest marine sanctuaries. Now Palau wants visitors to take a stand for the planet as well.\n\nThe Guardian reports that all tourists entering Palau are now required to sign an eco-pledge stamped into their passports. The pledge is addressed specifically to the children of Palau, who also helped craft it, and reads in full: \u201cChildren of Palau, I take this pledge, as your guest, to preserve and protect your beautiful and unique island home. I vow to tread lightly, act kindly, and explore mindfully. I shall not take what is not given. I shall not harm what does not harm me. The only footprints I shall leave are those that will wash away.\u201d\n\nThe pledge represents the first time a country has changed its immigration laws in the name of environmental protection. Visitors will also receive a list of illegal activities upon entering the country, including the collection of marine life souvenirs, feeding marine life, touching coral, or littering.\n\nPresident Tommy Remengesau hopes the pledge will help visitors understand the fragility of the environment, and that it will have a ripple effect beyond Palau. \u201cWhile Palau may be a small-island nation, we are a large ocean-state and conservation is at the heart of our culture,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe rely on our environment to survive and if our beautiful country is lost to environmental degradation, we will be the last generation to enjoy both its beauty and life-sustaining biodiversity.\u201d\n\nCall of the Wild\n\nBotched Rescue\n\nIn a desperate attempt to buy more time for the last few individuals of a dying species, a team of marine mammal scientists and conservationists set out to capture the world\u2019s remaining vaquitas from Mexico\u2019s Sea of Cortez last October. The idea was to hold these tiny porpoises in a temporary sanctuary where they could breed in safety.\n\nVaquitas have been disappearing at an alarming rate due to drowning in illegal fishing nets in the Gulf of California. There are fewer than 30 individuals remaining of this species, which is endemic to a mere 30-mile radius of the Gulf of California in Mexico. The goal of the joint US-Mexico rescue team, Vaquita CPR, was to bring the vaquitas into temporary human care until all gillnets for shrimp and finfish were banned and removed from their habitat.\n\nSadly, the rescue mission didn\u2019t go well.\n\nThe rescuers had never captured live vaquitas before, and no one knew how the animals would cope with the stress. The first individual they captured in October, a six-month-old female, had to be released within a few hours because she began showing signs of stress in the holding facility. The team modified its floating pen and tried again in December. This time they captured a mature female, who, the team reports, \u201cshowed some positive signs of acclimating to her new environment.\u201d But then, her condition, too, started deteriorating. The team released her but she circled right back to them seeking, the team believes, emergency care, and died shortly thereafter.\n\nDevastated that they had brought this critically endangered species even closer to extinction, the team halted its capture operations indefinitely.\n\nFor now, the project is focused on counting the remaining animals by using underwater listening devices and taking photographs of their dorsal fins, each of which carries unique scars and markings, The Washington Post reports. The Mexican government might give each one identified a name, officials said, in hopes that personalizing the cetaceans \u2013 known as \u201cpandas of the sea\u201d for the black rings around their eyes \u2013 might galvanize public attention.\n\nUp in the Air\n\nBlame it on the Smog\n\nphoto Joe Diaz\n\nHas your teen been acting up? It could be something in the air. A new study shows that higher levels of air pollution mess with developing brains and result in increased teenage delinquency.\n\nThe impact of air pollution on the respiratory and cardiovascular health of the young and old alike is well known. But in recent years, more and more research has begun linking air pollution to human brain function.\n\nNow new research by the University of Southern California suggests that microscopic pollution particles, called PM 2.5, in ambient air can creep into developing brains, cause inflammation, and may damage brain pathways responsible for emotion and decision-making.\n\nPM 2.5 is particularly harmful to developing brains because it can damage brain structure and neural networks and, as our study suggests, influence adolescent behaviors,\u201d says Diana Younan, a preventive medicine research associate at USC\u2019s Keck School of Medicine and lead author of the study that was published in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology .\n\nIt is possible that growing up in places with unhealthy levels of small particles outdoors may have negative behavioral outcomes similar to exposure to lead, Younan says, noting how previous studies have shown that early exposure to lead (in air or in soil) disrupts brain development and increases aggressive behavior and juvenile delinquency.\n\nThe study followed 682 children in the Greater Los Angeles area for 9 years, starting when they were 9 years old. The researchers used air quality monitors to measure the ambient PM 2.5 levels outside each child\u2019s home. Meanwhile parents completed a child-behavior checklist every few years and noted if their child had engaged in rule-breaking behaviors such as lying and cheating, truancy, stealing, vandalism, arson, or substance abuse.\n\nAbout 75 percent of the research participants breathed ambient air pollution that exceeded the federal recommended maximums of 12 micrograms per cubic meter. Some areas had nearly double the recommended limits of these particles. Unsurprisingly, these areas comprised poorer, less ideal neighborhoods, including housing developments near freeways with limited green space or foliage.\n\nThe researchers found that bad behaviors associated with increased outdoor air pollution levels were magnified when children did not have good relationships with their parents, lived with depressed mothers, or grew up in homes with higher levels of parental stress.\n\n\u201cBoth lead and PM 2.5 are environmental factors that we can clean up through a concerted intervention effort and policy change,\u201d Younan says. Not an easy task in this fraught political climate. And sadly, even if accomplished, neither would help establish the \u201chealthy family dynamics\u201d that Younan recommends.\n\nTemperature Gauge\n\nToo Hot for Males\n\nphoto Pierre Pouliquin\n\nThe northern stretches of the Great Barrier Reef offer refuge to a thriving population of endangered green sea turtles. This colony \u2013 which, with 200,000 sea turtles, is among the largest in the world \u2013 faces a new, unusual challenge: It is not producing any males.\n\nAccording to a recent study published in Current Biology , more than 99 percent of all turtles born on beaches along the northern stretches of the reef since the late 1990s have been female. The culprit behind this imbalance? Rising temperatures associated with global warming. As scientists have long known, sea turtle gender is influenced by temperature \u2013 cooler temperatures favor male turtles, whereas warmer weather produces more females.\n\nThe researchers compared female-to-male turtle ratios in two distinct Great Barrier Reef populations: one in the southern reaches of the reef where temperatures are lower, the second in the north where temperatures have consistently exceeded the so-called \u201cpivotal\u201d temperature that favors production of female green sea turtles, 85 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nTheir findings were dramatic. Within the southern population, roughly two-thirds of the turtles were female. (This is a typical sex ratio for the species.) Within the northern population, however, 86 percent of adult turtles were female. And among turtles between the ages of four and twenty-three, practically all turtles were female.\n\n\u201cVirtually no male turtles are now being produced from these nesting beaches,\u201d the scientists wrote of the northern population.\n\nThe findings could have far-reaching implications. Green sea turtles are far from the only animal with temperature-dependent gender determination. Many reptile species could be similarly impacted as their \u201cpivotal\u201d temperatures are more frequently exceeded as the climate warms. Many of these same species are also endangered, including six of the seven sea turtle species that live in US waters.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s not yet clear how many male turtles are required to sustain a population. \u201cA few males can go a long way in a sea turtle population,\u201d Michael Jensen, study co-author and researcher with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told News Deeply . \u201cWhat we need to know is how far you can push the female bias before it becomes a problem.\u201d\n\nThe researchers plan to expand their study to other green sea turtle populations in the Pacific Ocean. And then, armed with additional information, conservationists might turn to solutions, such as shading nesting beaches to keep them cool during egg incubation.\n\nAround the World\n\nThe Show Cannot Go On\n\nAnimal suffering in the name of human entertainment is nothing new. The modern circus dates back to eighteenth-century England, and the first wild animal circus acts emerged in both America and Europe in the early nineteenth. The animals rights movement, too, dates back centuries, and for years activists have been fighting the use of animals in roving shows, pointing to the cruel training, horrendous living conditions, and grueling travel circus animals are forced to endure. In recent years, their cause has been picking up steam.\n\nA decade ago, just a handful of countries had banned the use of wild animals in circuses. Today, more than 40 countries have passed some sort of legislation against the use of wild animals for entertainment, including roughly three-fourths of the European Union. And a smattering of nations have outright banned use of any performing animals, wild or domestic, in these shows. In places where national bans don\u2019t exist, municipalities have jumped in to fill the gaps: In the US, for example, more than 80 cities and towns have passed full or partial bans on animals in circuses. There\u2019s still much progress to be made, but it seems more than plausible that animal-focused entertainment could soon become a thing of the past.\n\n1 Costa Rica\n\nAs is the case with many environmental issues, Costa Rica leads the pack when it comes to animal rights. The Central American nation banned circuses with animal acts back in 2002. In 2005, Costa Rica also took a stand on cetacean rights, making it illegal to touch, feed, catch, or kill marine mammals, or to keep marine mammals captive.\n\n2 United States\n\nThere is no federal ban on animal performances in the US. But over the past several years, dozens of cities across nearly 30 states across have enacted various circus-related animal bans. In many ways, California has led the way. In 2014, both Los Angeles and Oakland banned the use of bullhooks \u2013 a painful tool used to train elephants \u2013 in circus performances, effectively preventing elephant performances in the cities. In 2015, San Francisco took things further, banning all performances of wild and exotic animals for public entertainment, including in circuses or on movie and TV sets. And in 2017, Los Angeles became the largest US city to ban wild animal performances for human entertainment.\n\n3 Bolivia\n\nIn 2009, Bolivia became the first country to ban any and all use of animals \u2013 wild and domestic \u2013 in circuses, enacting a law that states that the use of animals for public entertainment \u201cconstitutes an act of cruelty.\u201d It also includes a ban on marine mammal performances. Several other South American countries have enacted nationwide bans on wild animals in circuses, including Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Peru.\n\n4 Italy\n\nItaly has one of the biggest circus industries in the world, with an estimated 100 circuses and 2,000 circus animals. In November 2017, the parliament voted to ban all animals in circuses and other travelling shows. The Italian ban comes as part of a wave of animal entertainment bans sweeping Europe in recent months: In January, Ireland, Scotland, Latvia, and Romania all banned the use of wild animals in circuses, and Wales and England are currently considering bans; they would be joining more than a dozen European countries with bans on wild animal performances.\n\n5 India\n\nIn 2017, India became one of the only nations in Asia to pass a ban on all wild animals in circuses. The county previously banned the use of bears, apes, lions, tigers, and leopards, and had cancelled registration for several individual circuses following animal cruelty findings. The 2017 decision extends to all wild animals and all circuses. Since 2013, it has also been illegal to keep dolphins in captivity for public entertainment purposes in India. Elsewhere in Asia, Singapore has banned the use of wild animals in circuses since 2002, and Iran effectively enacted a ban in 2016 when it announced it would no longer issues permits for wild animals in circuses.\n\nUp in the Air\n\nAir Pollution Causes Landslides?\n\nIt\u2019s a well-documented fact that air pollution is bad for our health. Every year, millions of premature deaths are linked to the toxic air we breathe. An estimated one in six people die from the combined impact of air, water, and soil pollution. But can polluted air literally knock us down in our tracks? According to new research, it just might.\n\nA study published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters found that acid rain from the burning of coal may have contributed to a deadly 2009 landslide in southwestern China. The landslide, which killed 74 people, had no clear trigger, such as an earthquake or heavy rains. The researchers, geoscientists Ming Zhang and Mauri McSaveney, believe that sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide released from coal combustion and then converted to sulfuric and nitric acid in rainwater changed the chemical composition of rock at the site of the landslide. The result, they propose, was a less stable rock formation.\n\nNo Comment \u201cYou can\u2019t stop consenting adults from being stupid.\u201d \u2014Bill Marler, national expert on foodborne illness litigation Marler was commenting on the latest Silicon Valley fad of consuming untreated, unfiltered, unsterilized, \u201craw water,\u201d which is being sold at select stores for as much as $60.99 for a two-and-a-half-gallon jug.\n\n\u201cWhen the idea came to us, we surprised ourselves,\u201d Zhang told Science .\n\nTo test their hypothesis in the lab, the researchers submerged a sample of shale from the landslide site in an acid bath. The acidic liquid dissolved the calcite in the sample. Calcite helps cement the rock together. Once dissolved, it left behind a weakened, more slippery rock.\n\nAnother impact of the acid rain is that it may be fertilizing microorganisms living in the shale. The researchers believe the rain provides these organisms with oxygen and nutrients needed to thrive, and in turn, the microorganisms feed more quickly on the organic material in the rock, destabilizing it. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting and plausible hypothesis,\u201d said Richard April, a geochemist at Colgate University in New York, who was not involved in the study. He noted, however, that acidic water had rained down on mountains for thousands of years, so it\u2019s unclear exactly how much acid rain linked to recent air pollution would accelerate the weathering of these slopes.\n\nZhang plans to continue testing the hypothesis using evidence from different parts of the world in an effort to determine whether bad pollution may indeed be contributing to deadly landslides everywhere from China to the United States.\n\nThe Great Outdoors Monumental Downsizing photo Bob Wick, Bureau of Land Management There are few landscapes in the United States that evoke the raw, primal power of nature as strongly as the canyon country of the Colorado Plateau. Here, amid a 130,000-square-mile swath of the Southwestern US, jaw-dropping cliffs and narrow slot canyons plunge hundreds of feet into layers of undulating sandstone. Within this otherworldly region are some of North America\u2019s most important pre-European archaeological sites, including cliff dwellings; granaries; and ceremonial pits called kivas, tucked under soaring rock alcoves. On December 28, 2016, after a long collaborative process between the federal government and the Hopi, Navajo, Zuni, Uintah and Ouray, and Ute Mountain Ute tribes, President Obama signed an order establishing the 1.35-million-acre Bears Ears National Monument, protecting these stunning lands. But last December, in keeping with his obsession to undo the work of his predecessor, President Trump signed an executive order that downsized Bears Ears National Monument by 85 percent, and nearby Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, established by Bill Clinton in 1996, by 46 percent. Condemnation from environmental groups was swift. \u201cThis strikes at a core American value \u2013 our commitment to set aside special places that preserve our heritage, enrich our lives, and honor the people who forged our history,\u201d said Rhea Suh, NRDC president, in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s an affront to the tribes who forged an historic proposal to co-manage these sacred areas \u2026 And this is just the beginning of the Trump administration\u2019s assault on our national monuments.\u201d \u201cNavajo people have advocated for protection of the Bears Ears for decades, and continue to use and value the land for their livelihoods and cultural practices,\u201d said Navajo Council delegate Davis Filfred. \u201cThis monument represents part of our history and our future.\u201d Many see the president\u2019s actions as a concession to extractive industries looking to exploit coal and uranium deposits that are scattered across the region. However, the rugged, arid terrain has thwarted many a past mining venture. Others say that the decision undermines tribal self-determination, and fear that it paves the way for further downsizing, or outright elimination, of other monuments. One rumored to be in the president\u2019s sights is Nevada\u2019s Gold Butte National Monument, also designated in the last days of the Obama Administration. It is the site where scofflaw rancher Cliven Bundy illegally grazed cattle for years. Immediately following the Trump Administration announcement, various tribes and environmental groups announced five separate lawsuits. The plaintiffs are arguing that while the Antiquities Act allows a president to designate national park and monuments, it does not have a protocol for the abolishment of one.\n\nOverheard\n\nMaking the Planet Great Again\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron isn\u2019t taking President Donald Trump\u2019s climate denialism lightly. In December, in a tongue-in-cheek dig at Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign slogan, the French president offered 18 climate scientists \u2013 13 of them from the US \u2013 grants to move to France and conduct research to \u201cmake our planet great again.\u201d The grants follow a promise by Macron to make France a \u201csecond homeland\u201d for US climate researchers during the Trump presidency.\n\nNearly 2,000 researchers applied for grants through the program, the vast majority from the United States. France will launch another round of awards next year, and in total, expects to fund 50 research projects with $70 million. Awardees will pursue three- to five-year-long climate research projects, a timeline that roughly matches the remainder of Trump\u2019s term in office.\n\n\u201cIf we want to prepare for the changes of tomorrow, we need science,\u201d Macron said at an event to unveil the first batch of winners.\n\nAwardee Camille Parmesan of the University of Texas-Austin told the Associated Press that it was \u201csuch a psychological boost, to have that kind of support, to have the head of state saying I value what you do.\u201d Parmesan will pursue research in the French Pyrenees regarding the impact of climate change on plants and animals.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time France has taken a strong stance on climate while simultaneously calling out US backpedaling on climate policy. This summer, following President Trump\u2019s announcement that he would withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord, France reacted by announcing that the country would become climate neutral by 2050.\n\nIt may take more than 50 research projects to truly make our planet great again, but France\u2019s push to bolster climate science seems like a good place to start.\n\nTemperature Gauge\n\nWorse Than We Thought\n\nAs far as predictions go, expect the worst. That\u2019s the verdict from two top US climate scientists who set out to determine which climate models are most accurate in terms of predicting how much our world will warm by the end of the century.\n\nRaw climate modeling results for a business-as-usual scenario \u2013 which assumes we will continue to spew greenhouse gases at our current rate \u2013 indicate that we can expect global temperatures to increase anywhere between 3.2 to 5.9 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels by 2100. That\u2019s a pretty wide range. Patrick Brown and Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution of Science undertook a study to find out whether the upper or lower end of this range is more likely to prove accurate and concluded that the upper range is the \u201cmost likely.\u201d\n\nTheir finding, which was published in Nature in December, suggests that most of the models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change may be underestimating future warming.\n\n\u201cThere are dozens of prominent global climate models and they all project different amounts of global warming for a given change in greenhouse gas concentrations, primarily because there is not a consensus on how to best model some key aspects of the climate system,\u201d Brown explains.\n\nThe researchers focused on comparing model projections of the spatial and seasonal patterns of how energy flows from Earth to space. Their strategy relied on the theory that the models that are going to be the most skillful in their projections of future warming should also be the most skillful in other contexts, such as simulating the recent past. And they found that these models tend to project greater-than-average warming in the future.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense that the models that do the best job at simulating today\u2019s observations might be the models with the most reliable predictions,\u201d Caldeira says. \u201cOur study indicates that if emissions follow a commonly used business-as-usual scenario, there is a 93 percent chance that global warming will exceed 4 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. Previous studies had put this likelihood at 62 percent.\u201d Yikes!\n\nFindings\n\nCamera-Shy?\n\nphoto Gregory \u201cSlobirdr\u201d Smith\n\nUpdate Brazil Says Tchau to Mega-Dams Brazil rang in 2018 with a big announcement: The country is ending the era of Amazonian mega-dams. The news came from Paulo Pedrosa, executive secretary of the mines and energy ministry, who announced the major policy change in a statement to Brazilian newspaper O Globo . Pedrosa cited resistance from Indigenous and environmental groups as a major factor in the decision. However, experts suspect that economic factors \u2013 including the falling costs of wind and solar energy and a dearth of bribes from the construction sector \u2013 also played a big role. Regardless of the motivation, the announcement is welcome news to campaigners who have long protested the social and environmental implications of mega-dam construction in Brazil, including the $11 billion Belo Monte dam on the Xingu River, which has displaced communities and decimated wildlife habitats. The policy change means that controversial hydroelectric projects, including those in the Tapaj\u00f3s Basin, will likely be abandoned. The government suspended plans to develop the Tapaj\u00f3s Basin last year, but never officially cancelled them, a sore point with anti-dam crusaders. \u201cIndigenous activists and economists have long known that these costly, corrupt hydropower projects are destroying lives, livelihoods, and the Amazon\u2019s vibrant but threatened ecosystems,\u201d Kate Horner, executive director of International Rivers, said of the decision. \u201cBrazil can meet its energy needs without mega-dams.\u201d As Mongabay reports, however, experts caution that the Brazilian Amazon is not completely out of the woods. Even without new dam construction, the region remains vulnerable to several threats, including from other infrastructure projects and industrial agriculture.\n\nCamera traps have been a boon for conservation. Thanks to the automated devices \u2013 which take a flash photo when motion detectors are triggered \u2013 scientists, conservationists, and nature lovers the world over have glimpsed the private lives of animals, uncovered previously unknown behaviors, and even discovered new species. But the ways in which camera traps might be affecting wild species are not as well understood. These devices are considered less invasive than other field observation techniques, but a recent study suggests that female jaguars in particular are becoming camera-shy, calling into question just how unobtrusive the technology really is.\n\nThe research, published last month in the journal Mammalian Biology , raises the concern that female jaguars may learn to avoid camera traps. Female jaguars are typically snapped less frequently than males during surveys, mostly because they move around less, and don\u2019t traverse such vast territories. However, during a 54-month study in Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest, 83 percent of all camera trap photos taken of female jaguars were taken during the first year of the study. After the first year of the study \u2013 which was conducted over five sample periods between 2005 and 2013 \u2013 it was nearly a male-only show. According to study author Ana Carolina Srbek-Araujo, this suggests that the females may have been deliberately avoiding the traps. Males also showed similar behavior, but to a much lesser extent, she adds.\n\nPast studies have demonstrated that animals both see and hear camera traps. Individuals of some species seem to move towards cameras after detecting them. Others \u2013 including coyotes, snow leopards, and tigers \u2013 are known to steer clear of camera traps once they\u2019ve triggered them. Whether or not jaguars in Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest are exhibiting similar behavior remains unclear, but according to Srbek-Araujo, preliminary data suggests they may be.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with predators that have a much sharper perception of the environment than we can grasp,\u201d Srbek-Araujo says.\n\nCamera avoidance could lead to \u201ca bias in determining both population size and sex ratios in jaguars,\u201d Srbek-Araujo writes in the report. And if, as the study warns, jaguar cubs learn to copy their mothers, \u201cit will result in a large underestimation of reproduction and incorrect estimates of populations dynamics.\u201d Previous jaguar population studies also may well need to be revaluated to account for this human-induced behavioral trait. \u201cHere and elsewhere, evidence suggests that we must recognize that camera traps can be an intrusive sampling method for some species,\u201d the study concludes.\n\nCamera traps may be offering up new insights into the animal kingdom, but they are raising more questions in their wake, questions that may not be resolved by the snap of a shutter.", "title": "Local News from All Over"}], "occurence_date": "13 Dec 2009", "occurence_timestamp": 1260723552630, "magnitude": 5.1, "actual_city": "California"}, {"news": [{"url": "http://kepu.sciencenet.cn/index.php%3Fs%3D/Index/datail/id/1043", "content": "", "title": "404 Not Found"}], "occurence_date": "30 Dec 2009", "occurence_timestamp": 1262198937330, "magnitude": 5.8, "actual_city": "Delta, B.C., MX"}, {"news": [{"url": "http://www.ktvu.com/news/national-world-news/tsunami-watch-canceled-after-77-quake-off-of-solomon-islands", "content": "A 7.7 quake off of the Solomon Islands was reported Thursday.

(AP/CNN) \u2014 A rare earthquake jolted the Mid-Atlantic region of the East Coast on Thursday evening, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey says the 4.1 magnitude quake struck just after 4:45 p.m., and was centered about 6 miles (10 kilometers) east-northeast of Dover, Delaware. People from as far away as Washington and New York City reported that they felt the movement.\n\nThe quake jolted downtown Dover, sending lawmakers and workers in the statehouse outdoors to see what happened. Police and emergency officials did not have any immediate reports of damage or injuries.\n\nJohn Bellini, a geophysicist USGS's earthquake information center in Colorado, said any damage would be limited.\n\n\"It would mostly be a few items knocked from shelves, cracks in plaster,\" he said.\n\nSgt.

Carberry, who is from the West Coast, said she told co-workers, \"I'm pretty sure this is an earthquake.\"\n\nShe said there were no signs of damage at the base, and no change was expected in its operations.\n\nThe jolt was strong enough in downtown Baltimore that a smattering of residents streamed out of office towers and into the streets.

On March 11, 2011, an earthquake occurred in the Pacific Ocean that spawned a huge tsunami. The quake itself caused considerable damage to the Japanese islands near the center of the quake, but the tsunami\u2019s impact was catastrophic.\n\nThe waves caused by the earthquake hit the Fukushima area with such force that over one million buildings were partially or completely destroyed and about 19,000 residents were killed.\n\nAt the same time, eleven reactors at four nuclear power plants in the region were forced to shut down. However, the tsunami disabled the emergency generators that would have provided power to control and operate the pumps necessary to cool the superheated reactors. The insufficient cooling led to three nuclear meltdowns, hydrogen-air explosions, and the release of radioactive material during the next few days after the tsunami hit.\n\nThe result of this disaster forced tens of thousands of Japanese to relocate from the area and the uncontrolled release of radioactive materials into the area and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe power plants in Fukushima are of the same design as some in New York State, which are located on Lake Ontario. While no one would expect the same scenario to occur, those plants have been the focus of state policies in recent years.\n\nThe plants, built in the 1960s, have exceeded their expected useful lifetimes. Generally, plants of that design and era are expected to be used for roughly 40 or so years. Yet those plants continue to operate under a deal negotiated largely outside of public view.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, negotiators from the Cuomo Administration and the plant owners agreed to a multi-billion dollar bailout of the plants \u2013 which were slated for closure. At that time, the state did not reveal the estimated costs, but subsequent analyses estimated that the costs could run anywhere from $2.9 billion to $7.6 billion over a 12-year period. The negotiation contained no new safety requirements for the plants, just a guarantee that virtually all New Yorkers would be required to pay to make the nuke plants profitable \u2013 whether they received power from the plants or not \u2013 to keep them open.\n\nThe safety records of the plants came under new scrutiny in a report issued last week by the Alliance for a Green Economy, an upstate New York nuclear watchdog organization. The report analyzed recent inspection reports and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) documents and identified three issues of concern:\n\nThe group identified regulatory violations without penalties: 18 violations of Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were reported between March 2017 and February 2018 for the four Upstate reactors, but no penalties or fines were assessed.\n\nThe group identified examples of weakened regulations at the request of nuclear operators. For example, at the request of one of the plant\u2019s owners, the National Regulatory Commission changed the requirement for what constitutes an \u201cunusual event\u201d regarding Lake Ontario flooding. As we all know, there had been extensive flooding last year in the Lake Ontario area.\n\nLastly, the group identified missed deadlines for fixing known safety and maintenance issues: one plant near Oswego does not have a containment vessel likely to be able to contain the pressure and radiation released by a meltdown and installation of a required vent has been delayed; the plant\u2019s owner is behind schedule for fixing numerous maintenance issues.\n\nNew York State should learn the lessons of the dangers of relying on nuclear power and follow the path set by California: move to shut down these aging facilities, and instead move toward greater reliance on solar, wind and geothermal power. Those power generators have been starved of adequate support since so much of the state\u2019s wealth is tied up in propping up the Lake Ontario plants. New York energy efficiency programs are anemic and lag far behind neighboring states and currently solar only generates about 1 percent of the power for the state. Instead of mandating that New Yorkers subsidize aging, inefficient, 20th century nuclear plants, that money should be redirected to 21st century conservation and renewable energy programs.\n\nBlair Horner is executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group.\n\nThe views expressed by commentators are solely those of the authors.

Hurricanes can be predicted and tracked weeks in advance, and even tornados, monsoons and blizzards at least have seasons. But earthquakes strike entirely without warning. Now, however, a new study suggests that we may want to brace for a surge of quakes in the year ahead, and the reason for the danger is an unlikely one: the rotation of the Earth has slowed slightly.\n\nWhile accurately forecasting earthquakes is impossible, a backward look through the seismic record allows geologists to detect some distinct patterns. In the new study \u2014 which was presented at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America, in Seattle, and published in Geophysical Research Letters \u2014 geologists Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado, Boulder, and Rebecca Bendick of the University of Montana, tracked the incidence of magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes worldwide since 1900. While in most years there is an average of just 15 such major shake-ups \u2014 already more than enough \u2014 there have been evenly spaced intervals in the past 117 years in which the annual total jumped to between 25 and 30.\n\nA little more than a century on a planet that is more than 4 billion years old is not exactly a representative time sample, but Bilham and Bendick noticed something else about these volatile, quake-prone periods. They seem to follow periodic slowdowns in speed of the Earth\u2019s rotation. Our solid planet is a lot less solid than it seems, and that\u2019s true not just of its oceans and air, but of its outer core, which is about 1,200 mi. (2,200 km) thick and is composed mostly of liquid iron and nickel. That molten ooze tends to slosh about, following a pattern that oscillates more or less predictably over time, much the way \u2014 on a vastly smaller and more fleeting scale \u2014 water sloshing in a bucket will move back and forth in a repeating cycle.\n\nSuch motion deep inside the Earth slightly changes the planet\u2019s rate of spin, adding to or subtracting from the 24-hour day by about a millisecond \u2014 a change that is regularly recorded by atomic clocks. When a slowdown occurs, the molten core continues to strain outward, obeying Newton\u2019s fundamental law that objects in motion will try as hard as they can to remain in motion.\n\nThat outward pressure slowly propagates through the rocks and plates and faults that lie above it. Bilham and Bendick calculate that it takes five to six years for the energy sent out by the core to radiate to the upper layers of the planet where quakes occur, meaning that after the atomic clock notices a slowdown you\u2019ve got five to six years before you\u2019d better buckle up.\n\nThe last such time the planet slowed was in 2011, and recent events suggest a troubling pattern again playing out: the magnitude 7.1 quake that struck Mexico City on Sept. 19; the 7.3 event on the Iran-Iraq border on Nov. 12; and the 7.0 off New Caledonia on Nov. 19.\n\nNot only does the new study suggest when there could be an uptick in quakes, it also points to where: near the equator, within a latitude of 30\u00ba north or south. It makes sense that this would be the danger zone because any given point along the equator \u2014 the planet\u2019s widest point \u2014 rotates up to 1,000 mph (1,600 k/h) faster than a point closer to the poles, so a slowdown in the overall spin would be more powerful along that midline. The Iran-Iraq quake occurred at about 33\u00ba north latitude, exceeding that cartographic limit, but not by much.\n\nNone of this says that 2018 will definitely be a more geologically unstable year, and it certainly doesn\u2019t pinpoint where any possible quaking will occur.

Most Californians live within 30 miles of an active fault, and more than 2,000 known faults crisscross the state.\n\nWhile all of California is earthquake country, each region of California has unique earthquake risks. In San Diego, earthquakes can happen on the Rose Canyon fault, which runs along the coast and beneath downtown San Diego, and on the Elsinore fault and San Jacinto fault, which run through the eastern part of San Diego County. San Diegans may also experience shaking caused by quakes centered south of the border, as with the magnitude-7.2 earthquake centered in Baja California that shook San Diego on Easter Sunday in 2010.\n\nScientists say the chance of a magnitude-6.7 or larger earthquake happening somewhere in California in the next 30 years is greater than 99 percent. And in Southern California, there is a 75-percent chance of a magnitude-7.0 or greater quake happening in the same time frame\u2014that\u2019s an earthquake nearly three times stronger than the magnitude-6.7 Northridge quake that caused widespread damage to freeways, office buildings and homes in 1994.\n\nFor more information about the earthquake risks in different regions of California, visit the California Earthquake Authority (CEA) website. CEA is a not-for-profit, privately funded, publicly managed organization that provides residential earthquake insurance and encourages Californians to reduce their risk of earthquake loss.\n\nBecause earthquakes occur without warning, the key to earthquake safety is being prepared.

It caused powerful waves that slammed coastal areas, including the Northern California community of Crescent City, where 11 people were killed. A surge about 20-feet high flooded nearly 30 city blocks, according to the Department of Conservation. A total of more than 100 people in the tsunami zone, from Alaska and down the Pacific coasts of Canada and the United States, were killed.\n\nMarch 11, 2011: Although not nearly as destructive as the 1964 tsunami, a magnitude-9.0 earthquake in the Tohoku region of Japan led strong tsunami currents that damaged harbors along California's coast.

Here's why\n\nFind Your Forecast Search by city or zip code\n\n\n\nMeteorologist Jaclyn Whittal\n\nTuesday, January 23, 2018, 12:35 - On March 11, 2011, a magnitude-9 earthquake shook northeastern Japan, triggering a devastating tsunami.\n\nIn 2004, the Banda Aceh earthquake, a magnitude-9.1 tremor that triggered a tsunami in Sumatra, killed more than 230,000 people.\n\nSo, with these relatively recent disasters in mind, when a magnitude-7.9 earthquake struck off the coast of Alaska early on January 23, 2018, it had people running for their lives, fleeing in their cars and getting to higher ground.\n\nIn the end, nothing happened. No wave, no tsunami. Great outcome, but why did it happen that way? We explore below.\n\nWhy do earthquakes occur in this area?\n\nThe Pacific Ring of Fire is to blame for tectonic plate movement in Alaska and in Asia. The Pacific Plate, and how it interacts with other plates, has created movement in our Earth's crust over millions of years helping to create the tallest mountains on our planet.\n\nSEE ALSO: NASA 99.9% certain major quake to hit THIS U.S. city by 2018\n\nThe Alaska area sits on an important subduction zone, an area where one plate slides beneath another into the mantle, the hotter layer beneath the Earth\u2019s crust. In this case, the Pacific Plate is subducting beneath the North American Plate, and the great plates are rough and stick together, building up energy that is released as earthquakes. However, there are different types of quakes that can happen along the boundaries of these subduction zones.\n\nCLICK PLAY TO WATCH BELOW: Tsunami threat gives West Coasters early morning scare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis earthquake was different, and that was a good thing\n\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey: \"The deepest earthquakes occur within the core of subducting slabs - oceanic plates that descend into the Earth's mantle from convergent plate boundaries, where a dense oceanic plate collides with a less dense continental plate and the former sinks beneath the latter.\"\n\nThese types of earthquakes are the most intense and usually the deadliest. This was the type of earthquake in Japan in 2011 and in Sumatra in 2004.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Years after Japan's tsunami, what's washing up on the West Coast?\n\nFortunately, the earthquake in Alaska on January 23, 2018 was a different type of quake known as a strike-slip earthquake. You can think about it as a sliding motion of a person brushing by your arm on a subway car, only on a tectonic scale, and strike-slip quakes are not nearly as dangerous as the kinds of earthquakes that struck in Japan and Sumatra.\n\nThe source of many of the earthquakes in the Alaska area is the Denali Fault System, extending for 745 miles along the boundary between the Pacific and North American plates.\n\nIt is here where we see movement in more of a side-to-side nature rather than vertical earth movement. Strike-slip faults with left-lateral motion are also known as sinistral faults. Those with right-lateral motion are also known as dextral faults. A strike slip earthquake is what occurred in Alaska, and as a result did not trigger major tsunami.\n\nWhen was the last major quake in Alaska?\n\nOn March 28, 1964, the Gulf of Alaska was devastated by the Prince William Sound earthquake which measured magnitude-9.2 on the Moment Magnitude Scale.\n\nIt caused landslides in Anchorage and raised parts of outlying islands by as much as 36 feet. The resulting tsunami reached heights of 200 feet as it swept into the shallow Valdez Inlet. 128 people died in this event, which also caused $311 million worth of damage.\n\nUnlike this week\u2019s quake, this tremor was a \u201cmegathrust\u201d earthquake, occurring where the oceanic plate descends underneath a continental plate in southern Alaska.\n\nWarning time was enough to get people prepared\n\nThe good news is that through social media, many people were able to get a to a safe spot quickly. People were broadcasting live on Facebook, allowing the world to watch in real time as, as far as anyone knew, a potential tsunami hammed. In the end, there was no such tsunami, thank goodness, and people along the West Coast of North America were able to put their minds at ease and return to their homes very soon after.\n\nFor continued coverage and updates on this developing story stay tuned to The Weather Network.\n\nWATCH BELOW: What's an 'ice tsunami?'", "title": "Biggest Alaska quake in years, but no tsunami? Here's why"}, {"url": "http://time.com/5031607/earthquake-predictions-2018/", "content": "There is no natural disaster sneakier than an earthquake. Hurricanes can be predicted and tracked weeks in advance, and even tornados, monsoons and blizzards at least have seasons. But earthquakes strike entirely without warning. Now, however, a new study suggests that we may want to brace for a surge of quakes in the year ahead, and the reason for the danger is an unlikely one: the rotation of the Earth has slowed slightly.\n\nWhile accurately forecasting earthquakes is impossible, a backward look through the seismic record allows geologists to detect some distinct patterns. In the new study \u2014 which was presented at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America, in Seattle, and published in Geophysical Research Letters \u2014 geologists Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado, Boulder, and Rebecca Bendick of the University of Montana, tracked the incidence of magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes worldwide since 1900. While in most years there is an average of just 15 such major shake-ups \u2014 already more than enough \u2014 there have been evenly spaced intervals in the past 117 years in which the annual total jumped to between 25 and 30.\n\nA little more than a century on a planet that is more than 4 billion years old is not exactly a representative time sample, but Bilham and Bendick noticed something else about these volatile, quake-prone periods. They seem to follow periodic slowdowns in speed of the Earth\u2019s rotation. Our solid planet is a lot less solid than it seems, and that\u2019s true not just of its oceans and air, but of its outer core, which is about 1,200 mi. (2,200 km) thick and is composed mostly of liquid iron and nickel. That molten ooze tends to slosh about, following a pattern that oscillates more or less predictably over time, much the way \u2014 on a vastly smaller and more fleeting scale \u2014 water sloshing in a bucket will move back and forth in a repeating cycle.\n\nSuch motion deep inside the Earth slightly changes the planet\u2019s rate of spin, adding to or subtracting from the 24-hour day by about a millisecond \u2014 a change that is regularly recorded by atomic clocks. When a slowdown occurs, the molten core continues to strain outward, obeying Newton\u2019s fundamental law that objects in motion will try as hard as they can to remain in motion.\n\nThat outward pressure slowly propagates through the rocks and plates and faults that lie above it. Bilham and Bendick calculate that it takes five to six years for the energy sent out by the core to radiate to the upper layers of the planet where quakes occur, meaning that after the atomic clock notices a slowdown you\u2019ve got five to six years before you\u2019d better buckle up.\n\nThe last such time the planet slowed was in 2011, and recent events suggest a troubling pattern again playing out: the magnitude 7.1 quake that struck Mexico City on Sept. 19; the 7.3 event on the Iran-Iraq border on Nov. 12; and the 7.0 off New Caledonia on Nov. 19.\n\nNot only does the new study suggest when there could be an uptick in quakes, it also points to where: near the equator, within a latitude of 30\u00ba north or south. It makes sense that this would be the danger zone because any given point along the equator \u2014 the planet\u2019s widest point \u2014 rotates up to 1,000 mph (1,600 k/h) faster than a point closer to the poles, so a slowdown in the overall spin would be more powerful along that midline. The Iran-Iraq quake occurred at about 33\u00ba north latitude, exceeding that cartographic limit, but not by much.\n\nNone of this says that 2018 will definitely be a more geologically unstable year, and it certainly doesn\u2019t pinpoint where any possible quaking will occur. It does say that the maddeningly imprecise science of earthquake prediction has at least gotten a tiny bit more precise.

From tornadoes and floods to wildfires and winter storms, the state sees more than its share of natural hazards. But prior to 2009, \"terra firma\" in Oklahoma meant just that\u2014earthquakes rarely shook the state.\n\nThen, after decades of seismic quiet where the state averaged less than two quakes of magnitude 3 or greater a year, Oklahoma suddenly saw a sharp uptick, to 20 such quakes in 2009. By 2013 there were 109 such quakes. Since then, the numbers have soared, reaching 903 in 2015 before dipping last year to 623. In the process, Oklahoma has surpassed California to become the most seismically active of the lower 48 U.S. states.\n\nIn 2011, a magnitude 5.7 quake and two related magnitude 5.0 quakes struck near the Oklahoma town of Prague, causing damage and injuries. Then last Sept. 3, a magnitude 5.8 quake struck a few miles northwest of the city of Pawnee, population 2,200. That quake, which occurred on a previously unmapped fault, was the strongest ever measured by instruments in Oklahoma. It shook a large area of north-central Oklahoma and was felt throughout the Midwest and as far away as Phoenix and Pittsburgh.\n\nA Seismic Detective Story, With Satellites\n\nEven before NASA studied the Pawnee earthquake, studies published since late last year by the United States Geological Survey and other institutions suggested that the earthquake was human-induced due to increases in wastewater injection related to petroleum operations. Injection wells place fluids underground into porous geologic formations, which scientsts believe can sometimes enter buried faults that are ready to slip.\n\nTo shed additional light on the source of the Pawnee quake, a team led by geophysicist Eric Fielding of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, used enhanced seismic data and satellite image analysis to more accurately estimate the location and extent of the fault responsible for the quake, its hypocenter (the point below Earth's surface where the quake began) and its aftershocks, and to measure how the fault moved. Results of their study were published recently in Seismological Research Letters.\n\nTo help pinpoint which fault ruptured and where the main quake started, Fielding's team updated the locations of earthquakes published in an Oklahoma Geological Survey catalog of aftershocks. The catalog included nearly 2,200 earthquakes of greater than magnitude 1.0 within about 31 miles (50 kilometers) of the Sept. 3 main shock.\n\nAround Pawnee, the main faults are oriented in a northeast or north direction. But most of the aftershocks to the Sept. 3 quake occurred along a line trending east-southeast from the epicenter. As reported in earlier studies and confirmed by Fielding's team, this told scientists the main shock didn't occur on a previously mapped fault, but on a new fault called the Sooner Lake Fault.\n\nTo determine which parts of the fault slipped in the earthquake, Fielding's team analyzed interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data from the Copernicus Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B satellites operated by the European Space Agency and the McDonald, Dettweiler and Associates Ltd RADARSAT-2 satellite. The team compared InSAR data from multiple satellite overpasses before and after the main shock to create images of ground deformation known as interferograms. The Pawnee earthquake is the first Oklahoma earthquake to be observed using radar satellite data.\n\n\"Radar satellites allow us to study details of earthquakes on faults that were not previously mapped and don't reach the surface,\" Fielding said. \"This allows us to learn more about the processes that cause earthquakes.\"\n\nInterferograms created by the team from the InSAR data showed the ground deformed in a pattern consistent with slip along an east-to-southeast trending fault. The interferograms also showed the quake did not rupture Earth's surface, consistent with field reports.\n\nSeeing the Unseeable: Creating Computer Models of a Buried Fault\n\nFielding's team next input the aftershock and InSAR data into a computer to create models of the fault's likely location and of which parts of the fault slipped during the quake.\n\nTheir preferred model of the Sooner Lake Fault calculates that it dips vertically and is 11 miles (18 kilometers) long and 9 miles (15 kilometers) wide. The model also calculates that the movement on the fault took place deeper than 1.4 miles (2.3 kilometers) beneath the surface, and that the parts that moved the most were located deeper than 2.8 miles (4.5 kilometers). These findings are consistent with a main fault rupture taking place in crystalline basement rock beneath more shallow sedimentary rock layers.\n\nClues Point to a Human-Induced Quake\n\nThe team's results show the main shock began at a depth of about 2.8 miles (4.5 kilometers) below the surface and moved downward to a depth of at least 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) and perhaps as much as 8.7 miles (14 kilometers), into the basement rocks below the sedimentary layer. This downward rupture direction is unusual for natural earthquakes. The fault slipped horizontally about 2 feet (60 centimeters) at a depth of 7.5 miles (12 kilometers).\n\n\"Our results showing a downward fault rupture are consistent with a human-induced earthquake resulting from wastewater injection, rather than a naturally caused quake,\" said Fielding.\n\nFielding said the research may help better manage induced seismicity. \"By understanding how and where earthquakes are induced by wastewater injection, we may be able to mitigate their risk by identifying zones that should be avoided for injection,\" he said.\n\nThe NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission, planned for launch in 2021, may help scientists identify faults responsible for earthquakes and learn more about their causes, both natural and human-induced. It will provide frequent coverage of all land areas twice every 12 days.\n\nExplore further: Oklahoma is laboratory for research on human-induced earthquakes", "title": "Study examines geology of Oklahoma's largest earthquake"}, {"url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-40628028", "content": "Image copyright Sanjay/Rakesh Rao Image caption The deepest holes are being drilled on a table-top mountain in Maharashtra\n\nIn the windswept skein of mountains in India's Western Ghats, geologists are drilling some of Asia's deepest boreholes in an audacious attempt to unlock the mysteries of earthquakes.\n\nThe site is Gothane, a table-top 3,051ft (930m)-high mountain in the western state of Maharashtra, lashed by squally winds and ringed by looming wind farms and damp green forests populated by Asian antelopes, wild boars and deer.\n\nMore significantly, the place is barely 10km (6.2 miles) from Koyna, the site of a devastating 6.3 magnitude earthquake in 1967, five years after a big, hydropower dam was built in the region. The December quake killed 177 people, injured more than 2,000 others and caused widespread damage and destruction.\n\nMountains are ideal places to set up water reservoirs for generating electricity, but water pressure can build up in the pores of the Earth and stress the crust to danger levels. Quakes can also be triggered by mining, fracking (hydraulic fracturing to recover gas and oil from shale rock) or extracting water from under the ground.\n\nGeologists believe there are more than 100 sites around the world where quakes have been triggered by filling of water reservoirs.\n\nAt Koyna, geologists say, earthquake activity began after the reservoir was filled with more than a trillion litres of water in 1962. Seismologist Harsh K Gupta says the Koyna region \"is the best site anywhere in the world where an earthquake can be observed\".\n\nImage copyright Rakesh P Rao Image caption The quake at Koyna happened five years after the completion of a dam in the mountains\n\nNo wonder then that Koyna is one of the world's most persistent earthquake \"hotspots\". Between 1967 and 2017, the region has seen 22 quakes with magnitudes ranging from 5 to 5.9, and some 400 quakes greater than magnitude 4. There have also been several thousand recorded smaller quakes.\n\nThe depth at the epicentres have ranged from 2km to 10km. (The last recorded quake was of 3.8 magnitude on 3 June). These quakes have caused no recorded loss of life or property in the past decades.\n\nThat's not all. In 1987, another reservoir was built on the Warna river, some 20km from Koyna. Six years later, there was a 5 magnitude quake near the reservoir.\n\nMost seismic instruments to measure quakes sit on the Earth's surface or in shallow boreholes. Scientists believe that by drilling deep into the Earth and placing instruments in the heart of a fault zone, they can monitor quake activity at very close quarters.\n\nImage copyright Thinkstock Image caption Scientists are digging deep into the earth for scientific research\n\nIndian geologists were clearly inspired by an ambitious experiment by US scientists to drill directly into the San Andreas quake zone for a unique view of how earthquakes work. The crack in the Earth's surface, which runs through California, is one of the most studied faults on the planet.\n\nSo between 2012 and 2014, geologists drilled up to depths of 1.5km at nine places in the Koyna region to gather information on its geology. Last December, they began drilling the pilot borehole. This posed different challenges.\n\nBraving inclement weather, scientists trekked up 4km (2.4 miles) from the nearest muddy, red earth road to the top of the barren, wind-whipped mountain. Trucks trundled up through the blinding mist carrying an imposing 90-tonne, 86ft-high drilling rig, steel drilling pipes, mud and cement tanks and other vital equipment. Tankers carried water every day for the 80-odd scientists and technicians who worked and stayed at the site because, ironically, there was little groundwater in the mountain.\n\nWorking 24/7 for six months on end, the drill dug deep into the Earth.

Credit: Copernicus/NASA-JPL/Caltech/OGS Oklahomans are no strangers to Mother Nature's whims. From tornadoes and floods to wildfires and winter storms, the state sees more than its share of natural hazards. But prior to 2009, \"terra firma\" in Oklahoma meant just that\u2014earthquakes rarely shook the state.\n\nThen, after decades of seismic quiet where the state averaged less than two quakes of magnitude 3 or greater a year, Oklahoma suddenly saw a sharp uptick, to 20 such quakes in 2009. By 2013 there were 109 such quakes. Since then, the numbers have soared, reaching 903 in 2015 before dipping last year to 623. In the process, Oklahoma has surpassed California to become the most seismically active of the lower 48 U.S. states.\n\nIn 2011, a magnitude 5.7 quake and two related magnitude 5.0 quakes struck near the Oklahoma town of Prague, causing damage and injuries. Then last Sept. 3, a magnitude 5.8 quake struck a few miles northwest of the city of Pawnee, population 2,200. That quake, which occurred on a previously unmapped fault, was the strongest ever measured by instruments in Oklahoma. It shook a large area of north-central Oklahoma and was felt throughout the Midwest and as far away as Phoenix and Pittsburgh.\n\nA Seismic Detective Story, With Satellites\n\nEven before NASA studied the Pawnee earthquake, studies published since late last year by the United States Geological Survey and other institutions suggested that the earthquake was human-induced due to increases in wastewater injection related to petroleum operations. Injection wells place fluids underground into porous geologic formations, which scientsts believe can sometimes enter buried faults that are ready to slip.\n\nTo shed additional light on the source of the Pawnee quake, a team led by geophysicist Eric Fielding of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, used enhanced seismic data and satellite image analysis to more accurately estimate the location and extent of the fault responsible for the quake, its hypocenter (the point below Earth's surface where the quake began) and its aftershocks, and to measure how the fault moved. Results of their study were published recently in Seismological Research Letters.\n\nTo help pinpoint which fault ruptured and where the main quake started, Fielding's team updated the locations of earthquakes published in an Oklahoma Geological Survey catalog of aftershocks. The catalog included nearly 2,200 earthquakes of greater than magnitude 1.0 within about 31 miles (50 kilometers) of the Sept. 3 main shock.\n\nAround Pawnee, the main faults are oriented in a northeast or north direction. But most of the aftershocks to the Sept. 3 quake occurred along a line trending east-southeast from the epicenter. As reported in earlier studies and confirmed by Fielding's team, this told scientists the main shock didn't occur on a previously mapped fault, but on a new fault called the Sooner Lake Fault.\n\nTo determine which parts of the fault slipped in the earthquake, Fielding's team analyzed interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data from the Copernicus Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B satellites operated by the European Space Agency and the McDonald, Dettweiler and Associates Ltd RADARSAT-2 satellite. The team compared InSAR data from multiple satellite overpasses before and after the main shock to create images of ground deformation known as interferograms. The Pawnee earthquake is the first Oklahoma earthquake to be observed using radar satellite data.\n\n\"Radar satellites allow us to study details of earthquakes on faults that were not previously mapped and don't reach the surface,\" Fielding said. \"This allows us to learn more about the processes that cause earthquakes.\"\n\nInterferograms created by the team from the InSAR data showed the ground deformed in a pattern consistent with slip along an east-to-southeast trending fault. The interferograms also showed the quake did not rupture Earth's surface, consistent with field reports.\n\nSeeing the Unseeable: Creating Computer Models of a Buried Fault\n\nFielding's team next input the aftershock and InSAR data into a computer to create models of the fault's likely location and of which parts of the fault slipped during the quake.\n\nTheir preferred model of the Sooner Lake Fault calculates that it dips vertically and is 11 miles (18 kilometers) long and 9 miles (15 kilometers) wide. The model also calculates that the movement on the fault took place deeper than 1.4 miles (2.3 kilometers) beneath the surface, and that the parts that moved the most were located deeper than 2.8 miles (4.5 kilometers). These findings are consistent with a main fault rupture taking place in crystalline basement rock beneath more shallow sedimentary rock layers.\n\nClues Point to a Human-Induced Quake\n\nThe team's results show the main shock began at a depth of about 2.8 miles (4.5 kilometers) below the surface and moved downward to a depth of at least 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) and perhaps as much as 8.7 miles (14 kilometers), into the basement rocks below the sedimentary layer. This downward rupture direction is unusual for natural earthquakes. The fault slipped horizontally about 2 feet (60 centimeters) at a depth of 7.5 miles (12 kilometers).\n\n\"Our results showing a downward fault rupture are consistent with a human-induced earthquake resulting from wastewater injection, rather than a naturally caused quake,\" said Fielding.\n\nFielding said the research may help better manage induced seismicity. \"By understanding how and where earthquakes are induced by wastewater injection, we may be able to mitigate their risk by identifying zones that should be avoided for injection,\" he said.\n\nThe NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission, planned for launch in 2021, may help scientists identify faults responsible for earthquakes and learn more about their causes, both natural and human-induced. It will provide frequent coverage of all land areas twice every 12 days.\n\nExplore further: Oklahoma is laboratory for research on human-induced earthquakes", "title": "Study examines geology of Oklahoma's largest earthquake"}, {"url": "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-40628028", "content": "Image copyright Sanjay/Rakesh Rao Image caption The deepest holes are being drilled on a table-top mountain in Maharashtra\n\nIn the windswept skein of mountains in India's Western Ghats, geologists are drilling some of Asia's deepest boreholes in an audacious attempt to unlock the mysteries of earthquakes.\n\nThe site is Gothane, a table-top 3,051ft (930m)-high mountain in the western state of Maharashtra, lashed by squally winds and ringed by looming wind farms and damp green forests populated by Asian antelopes, wild boars and deer.\n\nMore significantly, the place is barely 10km (6.2 miles) from Koyna, the site of a devastating 6.3 magnitude earthquake in 1967, five years after a big, hydropower dam was built in the region. The December quake killed 177 people, injured more than 2,000 others and caused widespread damage and destruction.\n\nMountains are ideal places to set up water reservoirs for generating electricity, but water pressure can build up in the pores of the Earth and stress the crust to danger levels. Quakes can also be triggered by mining, fracking (hydraulic fracturing to recover gas and oil from shale rock) or extracting water from under the ground.\n\nGeologists believe there are more than 100 sites around the world where quakes have been triggered by filling of water reservoirs.\n\nAt Koyna, geologists say, earthquake activity began after the reservoir was filled with more than a trillion litres of water in 1962. Seismologist Harsh K Gupta says the Koyna region \"is the best site anywhere in the world where an earthquake can be observed\".\n\nImage copyright Rakesh P Rao Image caption The quake at Koyna happened five years after the completion of a dam in the mountains\n\nNo wonder then that Koyna is one of the world's most persistent earthquake \"hotspots\". Between 1967 and 2017, the region has seen 22 quakes with magnitudes ranging from 5 to 5.9, and some 400 quakes greater than magnitude 4. There have also been several thousand recorded smaller quakes.\n\nThe depth at the epicentres have ranged from 2km to 10km. (The last recorded quake was of 3.8 magnitude on 3 June). These quakes have caused no recorded loss of life or property in the past decades.\n\nThat's not all. In 1987, another reservoir was built on the Warna river, some 20km from Koyna. Six years later, there was a 5 magnitude quake near the reservoir.\n\nMost seismic instruments to measure quakes sit on the Earth's surface or in shallow boreholes. Scientists believe that by drilling deep into the Earth and placing instruments in the heart of a fault zone, they can monitor quake activity at very close quarters.\n\nImage copyright Thinkstock Image caption Scientists are digging deep into the earth for scientific research\n\nIndian geologists were clearly inspired by an ambitious experiment by US scientists to drill directly into the San Andreas quake zone for a unique view of how earthquakes work. The crack in the Earth's surface, which runs through California, is one of the most studied faults on the planet.\n\nSo between 2012 and 2014, geologists drilled up to depths of 1.5km at nine places in the Koyna region to gather information on its geology. Last December, they began drilling the pilot borehole. This posed different challenges.\n\nBraving inclement weather, scientists trekked up 4km (2.4 miles) from the nearest muddy, red earth road to the top of the barren, wind-whipped mountain. Trucks trundled up through the blinding mist carrying an imposing 90-tonne, 86ft-high drilling rig, steel drilling pipes, mud and cement tanks and other vital equipment. Tankers carried water every day for the 80-odd scientists and technicians who worked and stayed at the site because, ironically, there was little groundwater in the mountain.\n\nWorking 24/7 for six months on end, the drill dug deep into the Earth. When they finished in June, the rig had blasted its way through the hard rock and reached depths of 3km or nearly 10,000ft where temperatures hover around 80C (176F).

Share your story with CNN iReport.\n\nWashington (CNN) -- A strong earthquake in Virginia shut down a nearby nuclear power plant Tuesday afternoon and sent out seismic waves felt by millions from Georgia to northern New England. Three aftershocks were reported by Tuesday evening.\n\nNo major injuries or extensive damage were reported after the 5.8-magnitude earthquake, which struck about 40 miles northwest of Richmond. The quake prompted evacuations of office buildings and the precautionary closing of monuments in the nation's capital.\n\nA surge in calls by cell-phone users after the event affected service in many areas, federal officials said.\n\nAftershocks of magnitude 2.8 and 2.2 were recorded later in the afternoon, followed by one of 4.2 just after 8 p.m. ET, officials said. More aftershocks are possible in the coming weeks.\n\n\"It's one of the largest that we've had there,\" U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Lucy Jones said of the quake.\n\nMost federal buildings in Washington had reopened by late Tuesday afternoon, but officials were taking all precautions before giving the all-clear to some of its most iconic structures. The U.S. Capitol was cleared for employees to come back to get their belongings, but inspectors asked people to limit their time inside the building while engineers continue to work around the complex.\n\nA helicopter inspected the Washington Monument, and it was found to be structurally sound, the National Park Service said.\n\nBut a secondary inspection revealed cracking in the stones at the top of the monument. Structural engineers on Wednesday will determine the best way to repair the monument before it is reopened, the agency said. The grounds have been reopened except for an area about 100 feet outside the plaza.\n\nU.S. Park Police spokesman David Schlosser said to his eye, the monument was \"clearly not leaning. It's standing tall and proud.\"\n\nThe Lincoln and Jefferson memorials reopened Tuesday evening.\n\nWitnesses reported a number of buildings were evacuated as far away as North Carolina and New York, where a 5.8 earthquake struck in 1944.\n\nThe quake, which was recorded at 1:51 p.m., was shallow -- just 3.7 miles deep -- and located 88 miles southwest of Washington near the town of Mineral, Virginia. The magnitude was initially reported as 5.8, then revised to 5.9, and then revised again back to 5.8.\n\nWith so many on the East Coast unaccustomed to earthquakes, many people were left wondering whether all that rumbling could have been caused by a truck, helicopter, an explosion or some other force.\n\nKate Duddy was in an office building elevator in Manhattan, alone, when the shaking started.\n\n\"I have never felt a quake before. It was scary having no idea what the cause was,\" she said. \"I felt the vibrations and the elevator stopped for a period of about five minutes.\"\n\nThe earthquake triggered the automatic shutdown of a nuclear power plant less than 20 miles from the epicenter after it lost electricity. The quake signaled \"unusual events\" at 12 other nuclear facilities across the East Coast and Michigan, U.S. authorities reported.\n\nDominion Virginia Power said both reactors at its North Anna plant shut down after the first tremors. Reidelbach said the plant vented steam, but there was no release of radioactive material. Dan Stoddard, senior vice president of nuclear operations for Dominion, said there was no damage to the spent fuel pool.\n\nOfficials were restoring full power to the site, which was operating on diesel generators. Stoddard said that might happen by late Tuesday, but that was before the evening aftershock. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was monitoring the plant.\n\nRelatively minor damage was reported in a few Virginia counties, including Louisa, nearest to the epicenter.\n\nSeveral school buildings had damage, as did town hall buildings, Louisa County spokeswoman Amanda Reidelbach told CNN. An unspecified number of minor injuries were reported in the county.\n\nDesi Fleming, a resident of Mineral in Louisa County, said the quake arrived with a rumbling \"that sounded like a train coming to a stop.\" It knocked down two chimneys on the converted 1900-vintage home that now houses her parcel-shipping business.\n\nTuesday's incident occurred in a known seismic zone in central Virginia, said Dave Russ of the U.S. Geological Survey. But the strength of the earthquake was a bit surprising. A 5.9 event occurred in 1897 near Blacksburg, he said.\n\nAt Washington's National Cathedral, spokesman Richard Weinberg said three 5- to 8-foot pinnacles had broken from the central tower. He said stone masons and engineers would assess the damage, which also included other pieces that broke and fell on the surrounding lawn.\n\nThe building was evacuated and closed to the public.\n\nWayne Clough, the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, said the national museum's landmark castle on the Mall had cracks in interior walls. There was no immediate indication of structural damage, but the 150-year-old building will need closer examination, he said.\n\n\"You want to do an inspection to be sure about that,\" Clough said.\n\nClough, who's also an earthquake engineer, said the geography of the Eastern Seaboard helped transmit the shock from the Carolinas to New England. The underlying bedrock is largely a solid sheet, \"so you get a lot more travel out of earthquake waves than you would in California,\" he said.\n\nThose waves extended to downtown New York, where court buildings were evacuated.\n\n\"I was trying to figure out what was going on, like everyone else,\" said Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, who said he had been through many earthquakes when he lived in California.\n\nMayor Michael Bloomberg said at an afternoon news conference that the earthquake was felt \"across the five boroughs\" of the city, but there were no reports of injuries and \"virtually no reports of damage.\"\n\nThe quake was also reported to have been felt on the island of Martha's Vineyard, where President Barack Obama was playing golf. He did not feel the earthquake, according to the White House.\n\nThe earthquake slowed but didn't halt major transportation services.\n\nService at major airports throughout the region was disrupted, but all were reported to have resumed normal operations about 75 minutes after the earthquake struck.\n\nAt John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark-Liberty International Airport, control towers were evacuated, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said.\n\nAmtrak on Tuesday evening said service between Washington and Baltimore had returned to normal speeds following inspections.\n\nIn Spotsylvania, Virginia, Tish Walker said she was spooked and staying outside for the moment.\n\n\"I used to live in California, so I know shaking and this felt big,\" she said. \"I grabbed my dog and raced outside; my first thought is always that the furnace might explode or a cabinet crashes down on top of us.\"\n\nCNN's Vito Maggiolo, Chris Lawrence, Susan Candiotti, Dan Lothian, Joe Sutton, Jim Acosta, Larry Shaughnessy, Matt Smith, Sarah Aarthun, Carol Cratty, Phil Gast, Brian Todd, Dana Ford, Catherine Shoichet and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.", "title": "Virginia earthquake rattles East Coast"}, {"url": "http://www.nbc29.com/story/15317014/59-magnitude-earthquake-hits-central-virginia", "content": "A 5-point-9 earthquake rocked the East Coast and the epicenter was right in our backyard, near Louisa County.

When high intensity earthquakes strike they can cause thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in damaged property. For decades, experts have studied major earthquakes; most have focused on fatalities and destruction in terms of the primary effects, the shaking unleashed.\n\nA new study takes a different approach to generate a more complete picture.\n\nThe study, titled, \"Losses Associated with Secondary Effects in Earthquakes,\" published in Frontiers in Built Environment, looks at the devastation resulting from secondary disasters, such as tsunamis, liquefaction of sediments, fires, landslides, and flooding that occurred during 100 key earthquakes that occurred from 1900 to the present. And unlike previous studies, Daniell et al put a dollar value to the devastation from these secondary causes.\n\nSince 1900, 2.3 million people have died in 2,233 earthquakes, yet it is important to understand that 93 percent of the fatalities that occurred as a result of violent earthquakes happened in only 1 percent of key earthquakes. In other words, the worst devastation tends to happen in only a very few quakes and generally as a result of dire secondary effects. Indeed fully 40 percent of economic losses and deaths result from secondary effects rather than the shaking itself. Several key earthquakes have changed our knowledge of secondary effects and serve as models to understand and heed in planning communities, homes and buildings, highways, and infrastructure such as nuclear power plants.\n\nIn 2004 the Indian Ocean earthquake unleashed tsunamis that killed a total of 227,300 people in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand, plus more than $10 billion in damages. In 2011, the Tohoku earthquake created a series of huge tsunami waves, which damaged coastal communities killing more than 17,900 people, forcing more than 50,000 households to relocate, and caused the Fukushima nuclear power plant failure, a nuclear disaster second only to Chernobyl in Russia in 1986, but which spread radiation across the Pacific Ocean. Studying the Indian Ocean and Tohoku earthquakes gives us information to create maximum tsunami height models for these high risk areas to better predict how populations, property, and gross domestic product might be impacted in the future by similar events.\n\nThe 1995 Kobe earthquake, also in Japan, and the 2011 Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand provide insight into the devastation that liquefaction can cause. Liquefaction occurs when sandy soils that are partially or fully saturated are turned from solids to liquid by the stress exerted upon the material by the earthquake. The result: soils that suddenly lose their strength and integrity and flow as landslides; liquefaction is especially destructive to buildings, highways, and mountain communities, such as Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\nIn the past, fire has been the greatest contributor to damage following earthquakes. The 1906 San Francisco fire, created an inferno of property damage. Five-sixths of the total damage was due to fire, worth tens of billions of dollars in today's market. Many of San Francisco's Victorian-era mansions, shops and businesses, and infrastructure\u2014indeed, whole neighborhoods\u2014burned to the ground in the city by the bay. In 1923, again in Japan, a fire that erupted following the Great Kanto earthquake killed more than 92,000 people and was responsible for two-thirds of the total damage, amounting in today's market to hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nHigh intensity earthquakes can also cause severe flooding. While most dams and reservoirs have been designed to withstand earthquake forces, but the simple lateral motion of an earthquake can cause natural and man-made structures to fail, and unload large volumes of water. Landslides can also block rivers and create 'quake lakes,' which can then flood settlements downstream, as happened in 2008 following the Sichuan earthquake in China. The authors say that of 6,800 plus dams and reservoirs worldwide, 623 are expected to have a significant shaking hazard within a return period of 475 years and that of these 333 are more than 45 years old and should be reassessed.\n\nThe authors further detail their process for disaggregating fatalities and damages resulting from secondary effects as compared to the actual shaking caused by the earthquake by presenting two case studies: the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and associated tsunamis and the 1960 Chile earthquake and tsunami sequence and landslides.\n\nAs experts collect more data on secondary effects and resulting losses from high-intensity earthquakes, three benefits emerge. First, better models can be developed to understand the inherent risks and projected losses of building and living in certain areas. Secondly, scientists can reassess historic events, many of which were insufficiently recorded at the time. Thirdly, in this paper the authors demonstrate that to truly learn from these violent events data must be shared internationally and new technologies employed to process large volumes of information - otherwise, these tragedies appear as isolated, random events, rather than as natural disasters to which we can and must adapt.\n\nExplore further: Japan and New Zealand were hit hardest by earthquakes in 2011\n\nMore information: James E.

Credit: US Department of Defense As of late October more than a dozen wildfires north of San Francisco had killed more than 40 people, burned approximately 160,000 acres and destroyed more than 7,000 structures.\n\nThis tragic loss of life and property is unprecedented in California. However, the fires are not anomalous events in terms of their size, intensity or the speed with which they spread. Indeed, the path of the destructive Tubbs fire in Napa and Sonoma counties mirrors that of the Hanley fire of 1964. This extreme wind-driven fire burned under similar conditions, across much of the same landscape and covered an area substantially greater than the recent Tubbs fire.\n\nStrikingly, though, no lives were lost during the Hanley fire and only 29 structures were destroyed. Why did these two fires, 50 years apart, burn on the same general landscape, under similar extreme winds, with such different human impacts? Fire scientists will study these events intensively to parse out the relative importance of various factors. But it is clear that two factors probably were major contributors: wind and population growth.\n\nDriven by Diablo winds\n\nThe Tubbs fire began on the night of Oct. 8 near Calistoga in Sonoma County under extreme fire weather conditions, with high winds and low relative humidity. Normally, winds in this region flow from the west, carrying cool, humid air from the ocean onshore. These winds reversed that pattern: They blew out of the northeast at 40 miles per hour, with gusts up to 75 miles per hour. Such winds are common in California during the autumn, and are known as Diablo, Mono or North winds in Northern California and Santa Ana winds in Southern California.\n\nThese hot, dry winds develop from an unusual pattern of high and low pressure cells, and are most prominent in autumn. They follow the normal summer and fall drought that occurs in this Mediterranean-type climate, leading to severe fire weather conditions. Such winds are associated with some of the most catastrophic fires in California's history. In the San Francisco Bay area, they played a role in the 1991 Tunnel fire, where wind gusts of 60 miles per hour were responsible for 25 deaths, even though the fire measured only slightly over 1,000 acres. The speed of these fires is a major factor leading to the loss of human lives.\n\nSince fires in Northern California do not appear to have changed in this 50-year period, what accounts for the difference in impact? Certainly one critically important factor is demography. California's population has more than doubled in the past 50 years, but Santa Rosa, which was hit hard by the Tubbs fire, has five times as many people as it did in 1964.\n\nCalifornia wildfires photographed from space on October 9, 2017. Credit: NASA Earth Observatory\n\nPopulation growth\n\nThis dramatic growth can affect fire losses in several ways. Nearly all fires in Sonoma County are caused directly or indirectly by people, such as intentional ignitions or power lines igniting fires. Population growth raises the probability of fire igniting under severe weather conditions. More frequent human-caused fires also convert woody vegetation to more abundant herbaceous vegetation, which increases ignition probability and the rate of fire spread.\n\nPopulation growth also spurs urban expansion. Development has spread outward, positioning people closer to watersheds of dangerous fuels. These fires burned through grasslands, oak woodlands and dense stands of chaparral shrublands that last burned 50 years ago. Diablo winds are often funneled by particular topographic features, such as low-lying passes in mountains. This makes some parts of the landscape, which fire experts refer to as wind corridors, more vulnerable than others.\n\nThe so-called wildland-urban interface, or intermix, where development and wildland vegetation meet, is where most homes are destroyed by fires. Data presented at a recent Senate Science Forum show that both high- and low-density development in the areas where the California wine country fires occurred have expanded dramatically in the last several decades.\n\nWhat about climate change?\n\nMany accounts increasingly see climate change as a contributing factor in big fire events. There is good evidence that climate change will increase fires in some western forests, but there is little evidence that it will play a similar role in coastal California.\n\nIn a recent study, we examined over 100 years of California climate records and examined the extent to which higher temperatures in different seasons might have contributed to enhanced fire activity, and found that there was very little correlation in coastal California. We hypothesized that this was likely because in lower elevations, temperatures are sufficient to lead to large fire events in most years, and fires are more strongly controlled by the timing of human ignitions in association with extreme winds.\n\nSome reports have suggested that widespread tree deaths helped fuel the recent firestorm. The extreme drought of 2012-2014 caused extensive tree deaths, but most mortalities occurred farther east, in California's Sierra Nevada mountains. In coastal counties, in contrast, many trees have been killed by sudden oak death syndrome, a disease spread by an exotic fungal pathogen.\n\nPopulation growth in Santa Rosa, California. Credit: CA Dept of Finance\n\nHowever, according to the California State Tree Mortality Database, there were few dead trees within the fire perimeters in wine country. And in some instances fierce winds carried the fire to communities that were a mile or more away from dangerous wildland fuels such as dead trees. These facts imply that tree mortality played a minimal role in the destruction caused by this firestorm.\n\nStill another potential factor is above-normal rainfall during 2017. High rainfall increases plant growth in grasslands, which leads to increased fire incidence and spread. In all likelihood this did play some role.\n\nHuman factors\n\nLooking to the future, fire-climate studies in coastal California have concluded that in this coastal region, direct human impacts are likely bigger concerns than indirect impacts from climate change.\n\nOn the plus side, this suggests that there is great potential for altering fire outcomes by reducing fire ignitions. We do not yet know what ignited this year's Northern California fires, but extensive experience within the state points to several likely culprits: downed power lines, arson, debris burning and equipment such as generators.\n\nSince these fires started at night, debris burning and equipment seem to be less likely causes. However, there were reports of extreme winds blowing down power lines, and historically such events have started some of California's worst fires.\n\nCurrent U.S. Geological Survey research indicates that during the last several decades there has been a significant decline in arson-ignited fires in California and a decline in area burned due to arson. In all likelihood, increased fire prevention strategies have played a role in this decline. On the other hand, power line fires have not declined in number or area burned in the last several decades, and ignitions from power lines remain a statewide problem. Actions that can reduce the risk of this ignition source can include placing power lines underground.\n\nDrought and warmer climates have made wildfires a year-round hazard in California. Expanded urban development, in tandem with hot winds, seems to be the primary reason for the destruction this year. Once we better understand what factors made the 2017 fires so damaging, communities can prepare for future outbreaks in this increasingly fire-prone landscape.\n\nJon Keeley, Research Ecologist, US Geological Survey\n\nExplore further: Image: High winds, hot weather continue to fan California fires", "title": "Why were California's wine country fires so destructive?"}], "occurence_date": "08 Oct 2012", "occurence_timestamp": 1349677583020, "magnitude": 5.9, "actual_city": "California"}, {"news": [{"url": "http://earthsky.org/earth/6-4-magnitude-earthquake-off-coast-of-baja-california", "content": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is reporting an undersea, 6.4-magnitude earthquake that struck 142 kilometers (88 miles) off the coast of Baja California at 10:36 UTC (2:36 a.m. PST) on Friday, December 14, 2012.

The Pacific Ocean floor south of Mexico is being carried northeastward by the underlying Cocos plate. Because oceanic crust is relatively dense, when the Pacific Ocean floor encounters the lighter continental crust of the Mexican landmass, the ocean floor is subducted beneath the North American plate creating the deep Middle American trench along Mexico\u2019s southern coast.\n\nRead more from USGS\n\nBottom line: 6.4 magnitude earthquake off coast of Baja California on December 14, 2012.", "title": "6.4-magnitude earthquake off coast of Baja California"}, {"url": "https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/archive/2018-feb-17.html", "content": "", "title": ""}], "occurence_date": "14 Dec 2012", "occurence_timestamp": 1355481361590, "magnitude": 6.3, "actual_city": "Baja California"}, {"news": [{"url": "http://www.abc10.com/article/news/local/california/likelihood-of-a-high-magnitude-earthquake-over-next-30-years/103-511502981", "content": "", "title": ""}, {"url": "https://www.rt.com/news/416945-quake-los-angeles-california/", "content": "A magnitude 4.0 earthquake has shaken Los Angeles.

These figures compare the (left) observed intensity of ground motion from seismic stations of the California Integrated Seismic Network \"ShakeMap\" with the (right) simulated shaking (peak ground velocity) from SW4 simulations using UC Berkeley Professor Doug Dreger's source model and the USGS 3D geologic/seismic model. Both figures use a similar color scale, though they cover different spatial domains. Lawrence Livermore seismologist Artie Rodgers is tapping into LLNL's supercomputers to simulate the detailed ground motion of last month's magnitude 6.0 south Napa earthquake.\n\nThe Napa tremor is the largest to hit the Bay Area since the magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta event in 1989.\n\nUsing descriptions of the earthquake source from Professor Douglas Dreger of the University of California Berkeley Seismological Laboratory, Rodgers is determining how the details of the rupture process and 3D geologic structure, including the surface topography, may have impacted the ground motion. The earthquake ruptures from its epicenter south to north, directing energy toward Napa.\n\nSeismic simulations allow scientists to better understand the distribution of shaking and damage that can accompany earthquakes, including possible future \"scenario\" earthquakes. The simulations are only as valid as the elements going into the simulations, such as the source and subsurface models. Thus the recent earthquake provides data to validate methods and models. Simulations are performed with the LLNL-developed SW4 code by Anders Petersson and Bjorn Sjogreen of the Lab's Computation Directorate.\n\nDreger developed a model of the earthquake source based on the recorded ground motions. Rodgers is combining that source model with a 3D subsurface model developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (Menlo Park) to simulate the observed motions.\n\n\"This earthquake will help us improve the 3D model to better fit the observed seismic motions, especially at higher frequencies than previously possible\" Rodgers said.\n\nCompared to the Loma Prieta quake, the current seismic instruments have vastly improved and provide better spatial sampling of the source and geological structure.\n\nDamage occurred more in the sedimentary basins such as the Napa and Sonoma valleys and San Pablo Basin because they are made of weaker rock. Mountain regions close by felt less shaking because they are composed of harder rock.\n\nThe half meter slip on a 12-kilometer segment of the West Napa fault was not the most likely place for a large earthquake to occur in the Bay Area. \"It's a bit of a surprise at this site, though there was a magnitude 6.3 possibly on this fault back in 1893,\" Rodgers said. The northward direction of the rupture is well established, but details of the spatial and temporal evolution of the rupture remain to be discovered.\n\nMost experts expect the Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault system will be the next major Bay Area earthquake. In fact, there is a 30 percent chance that the Hayward/Rodgers Creek fault will rupture with a 6.7 magnitude or greater quake in the next 30 years, an event that would significantly affect the greater Bay Area. However, an event on the Greenville fault, which ruptured in January 1980, could be more damaging to the Tri Valley.\n\nFor now, Rodgers is focusing on the Napa event with colleagues at LLNL, UC Berkeley and the USGS. He said the current simulation capabilities far exceed what existed in 1989, allowing his team to perform higher resolution numerical experiments more easily and quickly.\n\n\"Also, we now have more high quality and rapidly available data as well as automated results to inform the public of details when an earthquake happens,\" he said. \"We're getting information in a couple of minutes or hours rather than a couple of days.\"\n\nRodgers said the prototype Earthquake Early Warning system operated by UC Berkeley provided an alert five seconds before the strong shaking arrived in Berkeley. This system worked well but could provide more warning by densifying and upgrading the region's seismic network.

AP journalists at the scene saw three rescuers entering the rubble.\n\nRescuers spotted the girl and shouted to her to move her hand if she could hear them, and she did, according to Foro TV. A search dog was then sent into the wreckage to confirm she was alive.\n\nTuesday's quake struck on the 32nd anniversary of the 1985 earthquake that killed thousands. Just hours before it hit, people around Mexico had held earthquake drills to mark the date.\n\nOne of the most desperate rescue efforts was at the primary and secondary school, where a wing of the three-story building collapsed into a massive pancake of concrete slabs. Journalists saw rescuers pull at least two small bodies from the rubble, covered in sheets.\n\nVolunteer rescue worker Dr. Pedro Serrano managed to crawl into the crevices of the tottering pile of rubble at the school. He made it into a classroom, but found everyone inside dead.\n\n\"We saw some chairs and wooden tables. The next thing we saw was a leg, and then we started to move rubble and we found a girl and two adults \u2014 a woman and a man,\" he said. All were dead.\n\n\"We can hear small noises, but we don't know if they're coming from ... the walls above, or someone below calling for help,\" he said.\n\nNeighborhood volunteers, police and firefighters used trained dogs and their bare hands to search through the school's ruins. The crowd of anxious parents outside the gates shared reports that two families had received WhatsApp messages from girls trapped inside, but that could not be confirmed.\n\nRescuers brought in wooden beams to shore up the fallen concrete slabs so they wouldn't collapse further and crush whatever air spaces remained.\n\nThe federal Education Department reported late Tuesday that 25 bodies had been recovered from the school's wreckage, all but four of them children. It was not clear whether those deaths were included in the overall death toll of 225 reported by the federal civil defense agency. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto had earlier reported 22 bodies found at the school and said 30 children and eight adults were reported missing.\n\nIn a video message released late Tuesday, Pena Nieto urged people to be calm and said authorities were working to restore power and other services to the 40 percent of Mexico City and 60 percent of nearby Morelos state that lost electricity. But, he said, \"the priority at this moment is to keep rescuing people who are still trapped and to give medical attention to the injured people.\"\n\n\"Every minute counts to save lives,\" the president tweeted.\n\nPeople across central Mexico already had rallied to help their neighbors as dozens of buildings tumbled into mounds of broken concrete. Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera said buildings fell at 44 sites in the capital alone as high-rises across the city swayed and twisted and hundreds of thousands of panicked people ran into the streets.\n\nThe huge volunteer effort included people from all walks of life in Mexico City, where social classes seldom mix. Doctors, dentists and lawyers stood alongside construction workers and street sweepers, handing buckets of debris or chunks of concrete hand-to-hand down the line.\n\nEven Mexico City's normally raucous motorcycle clubs swung into action, using motorcades to open lanes for emergency vehicles on avenues crammed with cars largely immobilized by street closures and malfunctioning stoplights.\n\nEconomist Alfredo Coutino, Latin America director for Moody's Analytics warned Wednesday of economic disruption to several central states and the capital in particular.\n\n\"Though it is too early for authorities to have an estimate of the damage as rescue work continues, it is certain that economic activity ... will continue to be disrupted for some time,\" Coutino wrote.\n\nThe official Twitter feed of civil defense agency head Luis Felipe Puente said there were 94 dead in Mexico City and 71 in Morelos state, which is just south of the capital. It said 43 others were killed in Puebla state, where the quake was centered. Twelve deaths were listed in the State of Mexico, which borders Mexico City on three sides, four in Guerrero state and one in Oaxaca.\n\nAt the site of a collapsed apartment building in Mexico City, rescuers stood atop a three-story pile of rubble, forming a human chain that passed pieces of rubble across four city blocks to a site where they were dumped.\n\nThroughout the day on Tuesday, rescuers pulled dust-covered people, some barely conscious, some seriously injured, from about three dozen collapsed buildings. At one site, shopping carts commandeered from a nearby supermarket were used to carry water to the rescue site and take rubble away.\n\nAs night fell, huge flood lights lit up the recovery sites, but workers and volunteers begged for headlamps.\n\nWhere a six-story office building collapsed in Mexico City, sisters Cristina and Victoria Lopez Torres formed part of a human chain passing bottled water.\n\n\"I think it's human nature that drives everyone to come and help others,\" Cristina Lopez said.\n\n\"We are young. We didn't live through '85. But we know that it's important to come out into the streets to help,\" said her sister, Victoria.\n\nRicardo Ibarra, 48, did live through the 1985 quake and said there hadn't been anything like it since.\n\nWearing a bright orange vest and carrying a backpack with a sleeping bag strapped to it, he said he and his friends just wanted to help.\n\n\"People are very sensitive because today was the 32nd anniversary of a tragedy,\" he said.\n\nBuildings also collapsed in Morelos state, including the town hall and local church in Jojutla near the quake's epicenter. A dozen people died in Jojutla.\n\nThe town's Instituto Morelos secondary school partly collapsed, but school director Adelina Anzures said the earthquake drill held in the morning came in handy.\n\n\"I told them that it was not a game, that we should be prepared,\" Anzures said of the drill. When the quake came, she said, children and teachers rapidly filed out and nobody was hurt.\n\nMany people spent Tuesday night on the streets next to homes that were severely damaged or flattened outright, wrapped in blankets on mattresses dragged outside. In the morning they walked past shattered buildings and picked through what was left.\n\nAt a wake in Jojutla on Wednesday for Daniel Novoa, a toddler killed when his home collapsed, family members bent over a white child-size coffin surrounded by a crucifix and images of Mexico's patron, the Virgin of Guadalupe. Alongside was a larger open coffin for the child's aunt, Marta Cruz.\n\nIn Atzala in Puebla state, villagers mourned 11 family members who died inside a church when it crumbled during a baptism for a 2-year-old girl. People at the wake said the only ones to survive were the baby's father, the priest and the priest's assistant.", "title": "Mexicans dig through collapsed buildings following deadly earthquake - Story"}], "occurence_date": "22 Mar 2014", "occurence_timestamp": 1395449889440, "magnitude": 5.3, "actual_city": "San Felipe, Mexico"}, {"news": [{"url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/magnitude-5-1-earthquake-strikes-los-angeles-area-article-1.1738750", "content": "A 5.1-magnitude earthquake jolted a swath of Southern California Friday night, causing minor damage and panic while officials warn it could lead to a larger and much more destructive temblor.\n\nResidents are now picking up the pieces after what experts are calling the strongest quake to strike the greater Los Angeles region since 2008.\n\nThe quake was preceded by two smaller foreshocks, and more than 100 aftershocks followed, including a magnitude-4.1 that hit Saturday afternoon, the largest in the sequence so far.

He explains that due to corruption and the ingenuity of migrants and coyotes - the nickname given to people who smuggle immigrants into the US, there is always a way to circumnavigate a wall.\n\n\n\nThe shelter for migrants, perched on a hill east of downtown, is run by the Congregation of the Missionaries of St Charles (Scalibrini) religious order and serves immigrants and deportees in Mexico\u2019s largest border city. It was founded in 1987 to serve as a resting point for Mexicans heading north to work in the United States. The Scalabrini order specifically serves migrants around the world, and runs numerous shelters across Mexico.\n\n\n\nThe Casa del Migrante has capacity for 140 people, but in recent months the population has swelled to 200 on busy days.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe help the Government has offered has been minimal,\u201d says Mart\u00ednez Amaya. \u201cThe burden has really fallen on civil society.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Tijuana-San Diego region of the border - forced right up against the Pacific Ocean - was one of the first to be militarised and fortified, beginning in 1994. Two layers of fencing separate Tijuana from neighbouring San Diego. It is the busiest land border crossing in the world.\n\n\n\nMexican immigrants had a tendency to be seasonal - working during the summer in the US before ducking back across the border to spend the winter with their families. But after the terror attacks on 11 September 2001, the Mexico-US border was strengthened enforcing a change in immigration patterns. More Mexicans chose to stay permanently in the US, sending money home instead of returning to Mexico at the end of thw work season, and eventually bringing their families across.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the number of deportations skyrocketed. Today, more Mexicans return either voluntarily or by deportation, than the number crossing to the US.\n\n\n\nFrom 2009 to 2015, President Obama deported 2.5 million people from the United States. During this period, yearly deportations to Tijuana could top 60,000. Tijuana receives the most deportees of any border city.\n\n\n\nThe Madre Assunta Institute was founded in 1994 when the bishop of Tijuana invited the Scalibrini nuns to open a centre for female migrants.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe face of migration has changed,\u201d explains Mary Galvan, the coordinator of Madre Assunta. \u201cToday we see many families separated by migration.\u201d\n\n\n\nWomen who have been deported arrive at Madre Assunta, as well as Mexican and Central American women seeking to cross to the United States. They stay an average of 15 days, during which they receive legal and psychological services in addition to food and shelter.\n\nThe shelter is in a large house, next to the San Felipe de Jes\u00fan parish and the Casa del Migrante men\u2019s shelter. Mary Galvan says around 100 people are currently staying at Madre Assunta, including 62 Haitians.\n\n----\n\nIn downtown Tijuana, in an office just feet from the San Isidro border crossing, Maria Galleta is putting on a pot of coffee, and handing out sandwiches to three Haitian men who have arrived seeking help and advice.\n\n\n\nOrganisations in Tijuana have been overwhelmed by the arrival of thousands of Haitians, which began in May 2016. Most of the Haitians came from Brazil, where they had found work following the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti. However, the economic and political crisis in Brazil forced thousands to leave, and head north to the US. Until September 2016, the US offered humanitarian protection to Haitians.\n\n\n\nWhen this special protection was repealed, Haitians began staying longer in Tijuana. Since President Donald Trump took office, many have given up hope of entering the US and have decided to stay in Mexico. Organisations in Tijuana estimate 5,000 Haitians remain in the city.\n\n\n\nOne of the men in Maria\u2019s office explains he no longer has plans to cross to the US because he doesn\u2019t want to be deported back to Haiti. He came to the office to register for a Spanish class.\n\n\n\nLiliana Quiroz Garibay, 32, is sitting in the Deported Mothers office in downtown Tijuana. She has lived here for a year, and volunteers for the organisation, which supports women deported from the US, many of whom left behind their children who are American citizens.\n\n\n\nLiliana was born in Mexico City and her parents brought her to San Diego when she was five years old. When the father of her two children began to abuse her, she went to the San Diego police. But due to her undocumented status she felt they would not protect her, and so she left the US city and travelled to Tijuana.\n\n\n\nLiliana\u2019s four-year-old son is with her, but her eight-year-old daughter stayed in San Diego. It has been a year since she saw her daughter, and she has sought out lawyers to help her gain custody while living in Tijuana.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard being here in Tijuana, it\u2019s not like what I expected. I speak Spanish but sometimes I get confused writing. I lived my whole life in San Diego,\u201d Liliana says.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s entrance to the White House is the latest in a series of challenges for the organisations that serve migrants in Tijuana. Massive deportations and the wave of Haitians migrants already had the city on the brink during 2016.\n\n\n\nFr Pay Murphy of the Casa del Migrante wrote during 2016, citing Luke 10:25: \u201cIt is very clear in this moment, who is my neighbour. It is the displaced people who live in the streets of Tijuana, and now is the time that we act like Good Samaritans and give them a hand.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor all previous Tablet World dispatches click here\n\n\n\n", "title": "Organisations in Tijuana have been overwhelmed by the arrival of thousands of Haitians"}, {"url": "http://www.khq.com/story/36317913/death-toll-rises-to-at-least-15-after-magnitude-8-earthquake-hits-mexico", "content": "An 8.1 magnitude earthquake has hit southern Mexico and its said to be the worst quake the country has seen in almost 100 years.\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) - The Latest on the Mexico earthquake (all times local):\n\n\n\n7:45 a.m.\n\n\n\nThe quake that struck Mexico overnight matches the force of a magnitude 8.1 quake that hit the country on June 3, 1932, roughly 300 miles (500 kilometers) west of Mexico City.\n\n\n\nA study by Mexico's National Seismological Service says that quake is believed to have killed about 400 people, causing severe damage around the port of Manzanillo.\n\n\n\nA powerful aftershock that hit 19 days later caused a tsunami that devastated 15 miles 25 kilometers of coastline, killing 75 people.\n\n\n\nBoth the Mexican and U.S. services say Friday night's quake matches the magnitude of the 1932 temblor.

Nearly 20 percent of the earthquakes in the United States occur in Nevada, but most are small and centered in remote areas.\n\nKent said the odds of Friday's quake being a precursor to a larger one aren't all that long.\n\n\u201cThe standard seismologist answer is about one in 20 for this being a foreshock of a larger earthquake, but if you look at the Nevada record over the last 150 years, we've had an abundance of doublets and triplets,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you just use Nevada as an estimator, it's usually one in five or one in four odds of having an equal or larger earthquake in the next several days or weeks.\u201d\n\nIf a bigger quake struck closer to the metropolitan area, there could be substantial damage.\n\n\u201cThe Las Vegas Valley has an uncanny ability to trap seismic waves in a way similar to other basins like you might see in Mexico City or Katmandu. If you're gonna punch a lot of energy into the Las Vegas basin, it's gonna resonate for a while,\u201d Kent said.\n\nIf you have pictures of damage or videos of the earthquake event in progress, email them to ReportIt@fox5vegas.com or upload them to our website at reportit.fox5vegas.com.\n\nCopyright 2015 KVVU (KVVU Broadcasting Corporation).

But apparently measuring such activity over time is not an exact science.

That same day, a 3.4 quake occurred in Caliente, Nevada. And on May 29 a much stronger 6.7 quake hit northwest of Chirikof Island, Alaska. The next day, on May 30, a massive 7.8 quake rocked Chichi-shima, Japan.\n\n\u201cThe number has more than doubled over the last 10 years,\u201d says Mark Biltz, pastor of El Shaddai Ministries and author of the popular book \u201cBlood Moons: Decoding the Imminent Heavenly Signs.\u201d\n\nThe reason Christians interested in prophecy stay tuned-in to seismic activity is because of Jesus\u2019 words in Matthew 24.

The flow has now reached the ocean but is no threat to Islanders, scientists said.\n\nMt. Aira in Japan is active and spewing ash.\n\nUSGS put out information releases on three volcanoes June 12:\n\nShishaldin Volcano in Alaska has had low-level eruptive activity continuing over the past week, but was confined to the summit crater.\n\nHawaii\u2019s Kilauea Volcano eruption continues at K\u012blauea summit and East Rift Zone. Surface lava is active and within 5 miles northeast of the Pu\u02bbu \u02bb\u014c\u02bb\u014d Crater. This is the most active of Hawaii\u2019s five volcanoes and has been erupting periodically since 1983.\n\nPagan Island is a volcanic island in the Northern Mariana Islands in the Pacific Ocean, but the United States military has been in talks to purchase the island for live-fire training exercises. Formerly inhabited, the inhabitants were evacuated due to volcanic eruptions in 1981, although a report in the Huffington Post claims about a dozen people still live on the island in shacks with no electricity, plumbing or access to markets.\n\nAccording to an article at Extinction Protocol, a blog about seismic activity, the most ominous sign is increased activity at the world\u2019s super volcanoes, one of which sits in the United States.\n\n\u201cUnrest also seems to be growing among the world\u2019s super-volcanoes.

Some intense storms in that area were dropping rain at a rate of over 50mm (2 inches) per hour. Credit: NASA/JAXA/SSAI, Hal Pierce Hurricane Vance was a hurricane on Nov. 4 when the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission or TRMM satellite and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission satellite passed overhead and measured its rainfall from space. TRMM and GPM revealed areas of heavy rain within the storm before it weakened to a depression and made landfall on Nov. 5.\n\nThe TRMM satellite flew over hurricane Vance on Nov. 4 at 0953 UTC (4:53 a.m. EST). Rainfall derived from TRMM's Microwave Imager (TMI) data collected were overlaid on a 1000 UTC (5 a.m. EST) image from NOAA's GOES-West satellite showing cloud cover and extent. The image analysis showed that Vance had a large area of heavy rainfall near the center of the hurricane. Some intense storms in that area were dropping rain at a rate of over 50mm (2 inches) per hour.\n\nVance's power peaked late on November 3, 2014 with winds of about 95 knots (about 109 mph). Vertical wind shear had started to weaken the hurricane, but Vance was still a powerful category two hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale with sustained wind speeds of about 90 knots (about 104 mph).\n\nGPM, the successor to the TRMM satellite had two excellent views of Hurricane Vance on both November 3 at 0031 UTC and on Nov. 4 at 1101 UTC. GPM's Radar (Ku band), that is similar to that used on the TRMM's satellite, was used to show vertical structure of precipitation at both times. In the first view hurricane Vance was at close to peak power with a well-defined eye. On Nov. 4, the weakening hurricane had a closing eye with much lower thunderstorm tops.\n\nNASA/JAXA's GPM satellite data showed vertical structure of precipitation in Hurricane Vance on Nov. 3, at 0031 UTC (close to peak power) and Nov. 4 at 1101 UTC (weaker). Credit: NASA/JAXA/SSAI, Hal Pierce\n\nTropical Depression Vance Makes Landfall\n\nIncreasing vertical wind shear weakened Vance from a hurricane to a depression by Nov. 5. In fact, wind shear had increased so much it was blowing at over 50 knots early in the day.\n\nVance made landfall in western Mexico around 10 a.m. EST today, Nov. 5. At that time, an automated weather station located in the northern part of the state of Nayarit, Mexico, reported a wind gust of 52 mph (84 kph).\n\nOn Wednesday, Nov. 5 at 10 a.m. EST (7 a.m. PST/1500 UTC) the center of Tropical Depression Vance was located near latitude 22.7 north and longitude 105.7 west about 55 miles (90 km) southeast of Mazatlan, Mexico. The depression was moving toward the northeast near 13 mph (20 kph) and is expected to continue in that direction taking Vance farther inland. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 millibars. Maximum sustained winds had decreased to near 30 mph (45 kph) and Vance is expected to dissipate later today or tonight.\n\nOn Nov. 3, NASA/JAXA's GPM Satellite captured data on Hurricane Vance's rainfall and cloud height that were used to create this flyover animation. Red indicates rainfall rates near 50 mm/2 inches per hour. Credit: NASA/JAXA/SSAI, Hal Pierce\n\nVance may be dissipating, but the moisture associated with the depression will continue to bring heavy rainfall southeast of its center and across portions of central and northern Mexico and the south-central United States. The ocean swells creating dangerous conditions and rip currents affecting parts of the southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur coastlines are expected to diminish late on Nov. 5.\n\nForecaster Cangialosi at NOAA's National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted that by 10 a.m. EST on Nov. Vance's low-level center was becoming elongated, so the cyclone barely met the qualifications for a tropical cyclone.\n\nThe moisture that TRMM and GPM saw when Vance was a hurricane will continue to generate heavy rainfall. Even though the tropical cyclone is forecast to dissipate soon, the NHC discussion stated that moisture from the remnants of Vance and the area to its southeast should continue to spread northeastward across Mexico and into the south-central United States. This is producing heavy rains over portions of these areas, which should continue for another day or two.\n\nExplore further: Aqua satellite sees Hurricane Vance headed for landfall in western Mexico", "title": "TRMM and GPM satellites analyze Hurricane Vance before landfall"}], "occurence_date": "13 Sep 2015", "occurence_timestamp": 1442132048560, "magnitude": 6.7, "actual_city": "Topolobampo, Mexico"}, {"news": [{"url": "https://www.usgs.gov/news/wastewater-disposal-likely-induced-february-2016-magnitude-51-oklahoma-earthquake", "content": "", "title": "Wastewater Disposal Likely Induced February 2016 Magnitude 5.1 Oklahoma Earthquake"}, {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31215066/earthquake-rocks-central-northern-oklahoma", "content": "A big earthquake rattled residents throughout Central and Northern Oklahoma Saturday morning.

A camera at the station captured the shaking.\n\nMajor County Sheriff's Office dispatcher Cheryl Landes said there had been several calls from concerned residents, but no damage more than pictures knocked off shelves and walls.\n\nAt least 10 smaller quakes ranging in magnitude from 2.5 to 3.9 were recorded in the same area by late Saturday afternoon, according to the USGS. A magnitude 3.1 quake occurred near Crescent, about 75 miles east of Fairview, the USGS said.\n\nOklahoma's stronger and more frequent earthquakes have been linked to the injection into the ground of the briny wastewater left over from oil and gas production. The 10 earthquakes Saturday were in the same lightly populated area near Fairview, a town of about 2,600 that's about 100 miles northwest of Oklahoma City. The area has had several quakes of magnitude 4.0 since the start of the year.\n\nCan't conclude if this specific OK quake caused by human activity.But many quakes in area have been triggered by wastewater fluid injection. \u2014 USGS (@USGS) February 13, 2016\n\nGeologists say earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 to 3.0 are generally the smallest that are felt by humans, and damage is not likely in quakes below magnitude 4.0.\n\nThe strongest earthquake on record in Oklahoma is a magnitude 5.6 temblor, which has also been linked to wastewater injection. It was centered in Prague, about 55 miles east of Oklahoma City, in November 2011 and damaged 200 buildings and shook a college football stadium in Stillwater, about 65 miles away.\n\nThe second-strongest was a 5.5 magnitude earthquake in April 1952 that was centered in El Reno, on the western edge of Oklahoma City.\n\nThe hundreds of recent quakes have been mostly small to medium sized, and have caused limited damage. But a quake did knock out power in parts of an Oklahoma City suburb several weeks ago, and last month about 200 unhappy residents packed a forum at the state capitol convened by critics of the state's response.\n\nRegulators have recommended reducing the volume or shutting down some of the disposal wells. Gov. Mary Fallin last month approved the use of nearly $1.4 million in state emergency funds for state agencies working to reduce the number of earthquakes linked to the wastewater disposal.\n\nOil and gas operators in Oklahoma, where the industry is a major economic and political force, have resisted cutting back on their injections of wastewater.\n\nThe Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which oversees the oil and gas industries in the state, said Saturday that it completed the major work last week on a regional plan to address earthquakes in western Oklahoma.\n\n\"The plan will involve a large-scale regional reduction in oil and gas wastewater disposal for an approximately 5,000 square mile area in western Oklahoma,\" spokesman Matt Skinner said.

Can you guess what it is?\n\nThis map comes from a team of researchers writing in Seismological Research Letters, and it shows the 2017 earthquake risk in various parts of the country. You probably aren\u2019t surprised to see either California or Seattle in dark orange. If you\u2019re familiar with the New Madrid fault, you\u2019re not surprised by the blotch on the border of Arkansas and Tennessee. But Oklahoma City?\n\nYep. It\u2019s all because of fracking:\n\nMost of the induced earthquake activity in the central and eastern United States (CEUS) is caused by deep wastewater disposal. Injected wastewater causes pressure changes that can weaken (unclamp) a fault and therefore bring it closer to failure. Seismicity rates in Oklahoma increased exponentially beginning in 2009. \u2026.In Oklahoma, during 2016, a 13 February [magnitude] 5.1 earthquake near Fairview, a 3 September magnitude 5.8 earthquake near Pawnee, and a 7 November magnitude 5.0 earthquake near Cushing caused damaging ground shaking. These damaging events are thought to be the result of wastewater injection, and the potential for future large earthquakes causes concern to officials responsible for public safety and welfare.\n\nThat magnitude 5.8 earthquake in Pawnee is the largest ever recorded in Oklahoma. However, thanks partly to reduced demand for oil and partly to new regulations, the earthquake risk in Oklahoma has decreased a bit in the past year. For now, though, it\u2019s still pretty high.

Credit: Public Domain As Interstate 10 snakes through the mountains and toward the golf courses, housing tracts and resorts of the Coachella Valley, it crosses the dusty slopes of the San Gorgonio Pass.\n\nThe pass is best known for the spinning wind turbines that line it. But for geologists, the narrow desert canyon is something of a canary in the coal mine for what they expect will be a major earthquake coming from the San Andreas Fault.\n\nThe pass sits at a key geological point, separating the low desert from the Inland Empire, and, beyond that, the Los Angeles Basin.\n\nThrough it runs an essential aqueduct that feeds Southern California water from the Colorado River as well as vital transportation links. It's also the path for crucial power transmission lines.\n\nCalifornia earthquake experts believe what happens at the San Gorgonio Pass during a major rupture of the San Andreas Fault could have wide-ranging implications for the region and beyond.\n\nThey worry a huge quake could sever lifelines at the pass for weeks or months, cutting Southern California off from major highway and rail routes as well as sources of power, oil and gas. Southern California's cities are surrounded by mountains, making access through narrow passes like the San Gorgonio essential.\n\nExperts have also expressed grave concerns about the Cajon Pass, where Interstate 15 and key electric and fuel lines run. Other problem spots are the Tejon Pass, through which Interstate 5 passes, and the Palmdale area, through which the California Aqueduct crosses.\n\nOne of the most dire scenarios geologists have studied is a quake that begins at the Salton Sea. Such a quake would be particularly dangerous because the fault's shape points shaking energy toward Los Angeles.\n\nSouthern California has not seen an earthquake like this since humans started recording history here. But the geological evidence of such quakes is all around us.\n\nSigns of megaquakes\n\nIn Desert Hot Springs, hints of the mighty San Andreas Fault lie all over: The rise of mountains that created the Coachella Valley. The oases and palm trees - made possible only because earthquakes pulverized rocks that allowed springs to burst to the surface.\n\nA geologist's trained eye can even spot exactly where the fault is located. In one exposed cliff, USGS research geologist Kate Scharer showed how one side of a hill has moved northward and skyward compared with the right side - and the gouge in the hillside between them was the fault.\n\nFarther away, Scharer described how an old lower canyon was severed from the upper canyon and its ancient source of water.\n\nDirection matters\n\nThere's a reason why this particular scenario vexes scientists:\n\nAn earthquake arriving from this direction would point cataclysmic shaking directly into the heart of L.A., a kind of disaster that has not been seen since humans began recording history in California. Shaking could last for as long as three minutes.\n\nIn a magnitude 8.2 scenario, the earthquake would begin at the Salton Sea, and then - like a big rig driving on a freeway - speed up the San Andreas Fault toward Los Angeles County.\n\n\"It's shooting all of that energy straight into the L.A. Basin,\" Scharer said.\n\nWhy a quake that begins so far away matters\n\nAn earthquake that begins more than 100 miles from L.A. might seem like something you might not worry about.\n\nBut a magnitude 8.2 earthquake is no ordinary earthquake.\n\nThe traditional image of an earthquake might be to show the epicenter - the point at which the earthquake begins.\n\nBut that doesn't tell the whole story.\n\nA better representation of a large earthquake would show how the earthquake travels up the fault. And this becomes more important for large earthquakes, which require an incredible amount of area in which the sides of the fault move against each other.\n\nSo, according to seismologist Lucy Jones, if a San Andreas earthquake began at the Salton Sea and ...\n\n-ended at Mount San Gorgonio, it would be a 7.3 earthquake.\n\n-stopped at the Cajon Pass, it would be a magnitude 7.6 or 7.7 seismic event.\n\n-traveled up to Lake Hughes, the earthquake would clock in at 7.8.\n\n-and \"if it goes all the way from the way from the Salton Sea to near Paso Robles, we'd get an 8.2. So that's probably the biggest we can have,\" Jones said.\n\n\"I think it's going to go all the way to Paso Robles,\" Jones said of the next Big One.\n\nJones cited a recent study by Scharer that found that earthquakes happen at the San Andreas around the Grapevine on average every 100 years. It has been 160 years since the last major earthquake on that section of the fault.\n\nHope for L.A.\n\nHere in the Coachella Valley and across the West Coast, scientists have been busy installing new seismic equipment as they construct an earthquake early warning system, which could give places like L.A. seconds - or even a minute or more - of warning before the shaking waves arrive from an earthquake.\n\nThe project, however, is in danger of losing funding. President Donald Trump's proposed budget suggests ending federal funding for the early warning system. Southern California's elected officials in Congress have voiced support for continuing funding of the project.\n\nHere are some more answers to questions given by Jones and Scharer as they gave a tour to elected officials on a trip organized by the Southern California Association of Governments:\n\nWhy are we so concerned about the San Andreas Fault, when other faults are closer to cities?\n\nThe worst thing about an 8.2 on the San Andreas is that all of Southern California would be hit hard at the same time. San Bernardino, for instance, wouldn't be able to call for help from Los Angeles, which would have its own problems.\n\n\"With 300 miles of fault all going in the same earthquake, you then have everybody affected at the same time,\" Jones said. \"The San Andreas is the one that will produce the earthquake that's going to cause damage in every city\" in Southern California - including Santa Barbara and San Diego.\n\nWhy is the San Andreas considered so likely to rupture?\n\nBecause it's California's fastest-moving fault.\n\n\"It's a little bit like - the moron who is driving the fastest is the most likely to get into an accident,\" Scharer said.\n\nIf a couple were holding hands across the San Andreas Fault, what would happen when the earthquake hits?\n\nHere in Desert Hot Springs, the couple would be thrown down. The ground would shatter. And in a matter of seconds the two would be separated by as much as 30 feet, Scharer said, almost the entire length of a city bus.\n\nOne would lurch toward San Francisco, and the other toward the Mexican border.\n\nCan the San Andreas trigger aftershocks on other faults closer to the city?\n\nYes. One scenario of a San Andreas earthquake results in aftershocks on the Newport-Inglewood fault, which runs between L.A.'s Westside through Orange County, and the Sierra Madre fault in the San Gabriel Valley. \"We even had one in Sacramento,\" Jones said.\n\nEven the Hayward fault in the San Francisco Bay Area could be set off by an earthquake on the southern San Andreas Fault, Jones said.\n\nThis has happened before. The great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, estimated at being magnitude 7.7 to 7.9, sent a 5.5 aftershock to Santa Monica Bay and a magnitude 6 earthquake to Imperial County, near the Mexican border.\n\nCan you explain how the San Andreas Fault works?\n\nWestern California - San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara - is moving to the northwest. Areas to the east of the fault are moving to the southeast.\n\nHow fast has the San Andreas Fault moved in the last million years?\n\nIt has moved about 22 miles in the last million years, Jones said.\n\nWhen will the Big One hit?\n\nWe just don't know. \"Things don't happen like clockwork,\" Scharer said.\n\nThe San Andreas Fault does not slice under the city of Los Angeles. So why should Angelenos worry?\n\nLos Angeles sits on a basin filled with sand and gravel.\n\nSo when shaking waves come, they \"bang up against the side of the mountains and reverberate back out across the basin,\" Scharer said. \"Those waves are very effective at traveling through piles of gravel.\"\n\nCan scientists develop something that could absorb all the shaking energy from a massive earthquake before the city is hit?\n\nNo. The energy produced by a large San Andreas earthquake, \"it's like the size of a small nuclear bomb,\" Scharer said.\n\nAn 8.2 earthquake would produce far more energy than what was produced by the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima.\n\nDo small earthquakes relieve pressure on the faults?\n\nNo. \"Little earthquakes don't get rid of big ones,\" Jones said. \"The more little earthquakes you have, the more you have to have bigger ones.\"\n\nHow should cities cope with the earthquake risk?\n\nJones said utilities, such as water, electricity and gas, require more attention. \"If we don't deal with utilities ... we aren't going to be able and stay here and work,\" she said.\n\nAre California's building codes equipped to deal with big earthquakes?\n\nA few California cities have boosted safety regulations for older buildings in response to earthquakes. In recent years, several cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, began requiring retrofits of vulnerable apartment buildings. L.A. is even requiring retrofits of brittle concrete buildings.\n\nBut Jones is critical of minimum building standards for new construction in California, which she said allow for a 10 percent chance of new buildings collapsing and killing people in an earthquake.\n\nJones favors increasing standards for new construction, ordering new buildings designed so that they can be immediately occupied after an earthquake. She said that would increase costs by 1 percent.\n\n\"I think you need to be safe enough to walk into a building, so that you don't lose the use of it - and so your neighbors don't lose the use of their buildings,\" she said.\n\nAre new buildings built better elsewhere?\n\nJones says new buildings are stronger, for example, in Chile. That's because the country makes those who build new buildings responsible if the structure suffers earthquake damage in the first decade after it is completed.\n\nAs a result, owners have insisted on strong construction, Jones said. And the country rode out a recent magnitude 8.8 earthquake well.\n\nExplore further: San Andreas Fault 'locked, loaded and ready to roll' with big quake, expert says", "title": "Signs of past California 'mega-quakes' show danger of the Big One on San Andreas Fault"}, {"url": "http://www.cbs8.com/story/32699926/35-magnitude-earthquake-strikes-near-borrego-springs", "content": "BORREGO SPRINGS (CBS 8) - A magnitude 3.5 earthquake was reported Saturday morning six miles from Borrego Springs, Calif., according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThe temblor occurred at 7:39 a.m. Pacific time at a depth of 7.5 miles.\n\nAccording to the USGS, the epicenter was 23 miles from San Diego Country Estates, Calif., 27 miles from Ramona, Calif., and 29 miles from Alpine, Calif.\n\nIn the past 10 days, there have been two earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater centered nearby.", "title": "3.5-Magnitude earthquake strikes near Borrego Springs"}], "occurence_date": "10 Jun 2016", "occurence_timestamp": 1465545878700, "magnitude": 5.19, "actual_city": "Borrego Springs, CA"}, {"news": [{"url": "http://mountainjournal.org/will-climate-change-destroy-yellowstone", "content": "YOU RUMMAGE THROUGH A TRUNK IN THE ATTIC that\u2019s been handed down across the generations and happen upon a dusty old photo album.

The haze of woodsmoke that tinged their air in July at the turn of the century wafts in now from the west two months earlier, obscuring views of the mountains on many days.\n\nFew could\u2019ve predicted that when extreme heat events (high temperatures routinely in the 120s) coupled with shortages of freshwater caused social unrest a thousand miles away in the desert Southwest, from Vegas to California's Mojave, Phoenix and Tucson, it would also set off an exodus.\n\nNor, correspondingly, could anyone have grasped a different chain of events that linked Greater Yellowstone to the oceans: rising seas pushed by tropical storm surges causing hundreds of billions of dollars in damage to coastal developments, submerging some, sending huge numbers of residents scrambling inland when insurance companies no longer were willing to pay policy owners to rebuild or the companies went bankrupt.\n\nYet it happened. More than a million desperate \u201cenvironmental refugees\u201d poured into different corners of Greater Yellowstone on top of the others who originally came seeking the good life. As for what happened to Greater Yellowstone\u2019s famous wildlife, well, that will be explored in another story.\n\nNow, along the four-lane highway leading down Gallatin Canyon to Big Sky, a corridor of roadway three times as wide as the Gallatin River itself, you find every bend of the river on this March day crowded with masses of gray-headed diehard anglers waiting their turns to cast; each knows the current will be dipping fast as another short fishing season is brought to a close.\n\nIt\u2019s an odd ritual they do in remembrance of a pastime that long ago lost its meaning. Just as it is difficult to conceive of a \u201cski industry\u201d as once being a major pillar of the winter economy in the Rockies, so, too, is it a weird notion to ponder there ever being a thriving multi-million-dollar \u201cflyfishing industry.\u201d\n\nThe Gallatin River\u2014formerly one of Montana\u2019s crown liquid jewels that flows out of Yellowstone National Park\u2014is still regaled for being a location in the quaint 20th century fairy tale, A River Runs Through It.\n\nOn May 1 every year, the state of Montana shutters rivers to angling and rafting because of low flows and an attempt to reduce human stress on what remains of dwindling wild-reared trout populations. No matter, you can still fish simply by slipping in your Virtual Reality contact lenses and catch any species you desire.\n\n\u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0\n\nBack in the real world of 2068, low flows and warm temperatures on the Gallatin are mirrored on every stream in the region\u2014the Madison, Yellowstone, Big Horn, Jefferson, Shoshone, even the Snake in Jackson Hole where calls on water made by farmers in Idaho for irrigation have created huge tensions with federal land management agencies trying to keep enough aqua between the banks for fish and wildlife. Those summer days when a thousand inner tubers cooled off in July and August floating down the Madison River west of Bozeman? A distant memory. Now you can leapfrog the channel without getting your feet wet.\n\nA perk for the Gallatin; its cfs (cubic feet per second) flows are augmented with a perpetual release of treated sewage water dumped into the river channel because Big Sky proper, population 30,000, had no other place to put it.\n\nEncircling Lone Mountain, the forested panorama of evergreens present in the old family photos is now a mixture of dead arboreal snags killed by mountain beetles, black patches where fire swept through, and bare, brush-covered slopes where trees did not naturally grow back . One can also take note of the clearcuts that politicians authorized the U.S. Forest Service to carry out, based on the faulty premise that felling the forest of its old trees would prevent wildfire; now it is merely a testament to monumentally misguided thinking. Grasses and brush infernos still broke out from lightning strikes and careless human activity because climate change every summer transformed them into tinder.\n\nAs you leave U.S. Highway 191 and wend westward toward the old Big Sky Resort, there\u2019s another thing up the valley that didn\u2019t exist in your great grandparents\u2019 snapshots: a road that was pushed through the Madison Mountains as an artery to reach the Madison Valley, hastily blazed to provide a second emergency escape route for panicked citizens dealing with fears of fire and the potential of earthquakes. That, in turn, ignited an onslaught of development that poured into the Madison Valley turning many of the ranches not protected by conservation easements into massive real estate plays.\n\nSuch a vision, what some might consider dystopia, isn\u2019t a jeremiad coming from the mouth of a radical environmentalist. Rather, it\u2019s a prediction made by many experts thinking hard about climate change. Ski and trout towns, whose winter economies were built on the medium of frozen water, and the expectation it would also exist, are very different in the 2060s and their likely transformation, in a warming West, became harbingers.\n\nJackson Lake, liquid heart of Grand Teton National Park and important water source for the Snake River, on a recent late summer day. In that year, many reaches of the lake were left high and dry following drought conditions (expected to become the new norm with climate change) and irrigators in Idaho demanding that their water be released. In decades to come, whose interests will take precedent\u2014ecological and economic interests in Jackson Hole or potato growers downstream? Photo by Todd Wilkinson\n\nSo now, let\u2019s flash back. It is almost the year 2020.\n\nIn your great grandparents\u2019 era, politicians denied that such a future would ever be possible and citizens, who did not want to contemplate reality, kept re-electing them. In Washington, D.C, members of Congress waged constant war upon scientists who were studying human-caused climate change, denying any serious causal link between pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and rising temperature.\n\nThey systematically slashed the budgets of government science agencies. They said nothing when political appointees, who worked previously as lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry, were brought into the U.S. departments of Interior, Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Emergency Management Administration and others, creating such hostile working conditions in government service that career scientists fled.\n\nBrazenly, they dismissed out of hand a number of warning calls. One of them was a report titled \u201c The Montana Climate Assessment \u201d prepared in late 2017 by the Montana Institute on Ecosystems, overseen by leading scientists at both Montana State University in Bozeman and the University of Montana in Missoula. Research informing the report\u2019s conclusions was underwritten by a $20-million grant from the National Science Foundation, an independent federal agency and one of the most respected scientific bodies in the world.\n\nDr. Cathy Whitlock, a professor in MSU\u2019s Department of Earth Sciences then, and one of the lead authors, told a reporter the reason for the report was to deliver a regional assessment of likely climate-related outcomes in Montana pertaining to forestry, agriculture and water. Her colleagues said the findings could generally also be extrapolated to the neighboring states of more arid Wyoming and Idaho.\n\nPreviously, the International Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had prepared a number of global assessments that identified macro-issues but none that drilled deeper into eco-regions like the Northern Rockies and the interconnected high plains. It should be noted that professor emeritus Dr. Steven Running, then at the University of Montana, had been part of a team, separate from Whitlock\u2019s, that received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for its pioneering work in pondering the cause-and-effect of climate change.\n\nSo compelling was their wake-up call that even the U.S. Department of Defense, in the Pentagon\u2019s regular Quadrennial Reports for the four branches of the military, referred to climate change as both a serious national security risk and a major challenge to American interests around the world.\n\nThe Montana Climate Assessment involved a comprehensive congealing of historic temperature, crop and water data, a thorough review of existing peer-reviewed science and it used sophisticated computer modeling, given trendlines, to project likely scenarios as it relates to greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere.\n\nDr. Cathy Whitlock, professor of Earth Sciences and research fellow at Montana Institute on Ecosystems. Whitlock, also involved with the relationship between wildfire and climate, was a lead author of the recent Montana Climate Assessment. st century. In 2017, Whitlock said Montana had experienced an average rise of between two- and three-degrees since 1950. She and colleagues concluded that temperatures going forward would warm between four and six degrees more by the middle of the 21century.\n\nTo put this in perspective, even a small rise in temperature can result in \u201caverage\u201d low precipitation years plunging into full-on drought conditions; meanwhile, \u201cnormal\u201d drought conditions can quickly escalate into the severe category when streams feeding rivers run bone dry or are reduced to trickles. It also affects the \u201crecharge\u201d of underground aquifers that are fed by surface water which normally passes nearly unseen through the landscape.\n\nIn the three decades that followed the 1990s, when climate change data first started to accumulate and droughts became called \u201cthe new normal\u201d in the West, impacts to farmers\u2019 crops and ranchers\u2019 livestock inflicted billions of dollars in negative economic impact and costs associated with federal disaster relief. On top of it, billions of dollars annually during the first two decades of the new millennium were spent by the U.S. Forest Service fighting wildfires, consuming half of the agency\u2019s operating budget and hobbling its ability to do other things.\n\nThis could be anywhere, and will be everywhere. Photo courtesy NPS\n\nIn a different breathtaking analysis published by the National Academies, it suggests forests as we recognize them today will vanish: \"Continued warming could completely transform Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem fire regimes by the mid-21st century, with profound consequences for many species and for ecosystem services including aesthetics, hydrology, and carbon storage,\" the authors write.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The conditions associated with extreme fire seasons are expected to become much more frequent, with fire occurrence and area burned exceeding that observed in the historical record or reconstructed from paleoproxy records for the past 10,000 years. Even in years without extreme fire events, average annual area burned is projected to increase, and years with no large fires\u2014common until recently\u2014are projected to become increasingly rare.\"\n\n\n\nStill, some claim that climate change means good news, that warmer temperatures will yield longer growing seasons. That\u2019s true so long as it is accompanied by adequate moisture.\n\nSuch sanguine thinking also was rebuffed by forerunning geographer John Wesley Powell in the late 19th century who warned that homesteaders who believed rain would, by the providence of God, follow their plows were fools. And for much of the 20th century, many rural areas of the West emptied out. William deBuys, the great Powell historian, wrote in his biography, \u201cSeeing Things Whole: The Essential John Wesley Powell\u201d: \u201cMany thousands of families made a go of trying to farm without irrigation in the arid lands, and they suffered extremely. It was a bitter double cross on those hopeful people, and Powell saw it.\u201d\n\nWith climate change, what happens when the irrigation ditches run dry?\n\nIn the interior West, known for its aridity, experts say there will be another month or two of conditions suitable for growing grains in the middle of the 21st century, and that more moisture will likely come as rain rather than snow.\n\nHowever, it is also replete with an insidious paradox, scientists say. Warmer temperatures mean that enough added moisture must fall from the sky to offset the drying out of soils caused by hotter daytime temperatures as well as water that\u2019s lost to evaporation or isn\u2019t available as snowmelt.\n\nRivers are destined to chronically have their flows squeezed, Whitlock and colleagues say. Sorting out who will get priority in water use\u2014agriculture/irrigators, municipalities (flows at the tap, lawn and garden watering), developers buying up rights, or ecology (such as keeping enough water in streams to ensure fish populations can persist) could bring major cultural conflict.\n\nMoreover, there will be a lot of tough decisions with which society will need to contend: should, for example, water be pulled out of streams in order to feed non-native cattle by growing alfalfa when that same resource is crucial to the welfare of people and the survival of native wildlife?\n\nStartlingly, Whitlock also noted this: if the status quo of CO2 emissions continues unabated or increases as a result of burning more fossil fuels now being promoted by the Trump Administration, the end of the 21st century could actually see a temperature rise of around nine to twelve degrees. For dryland farming in Montana, it would be catastrophic. \u201cIf those temperature increases happen, it will literally be a different world, unlike the one we presently know,\u201d she said.\n\nFor dryland farming in Montana, it would be catastrophic. \u201cIf those temperature increases happen, it will literally be a different world, unlike the one we presently know.\" \u2014Dr. Cathy Whitlock, senior scientist at Montana State University\n\nSteve Running believes southwest Montana\u2019s climate within two human generations will resemble that of Salt Lake City\u2019s and arid stretches of the Great Basin. In the rural interior of Wyoming away from the mountains, where summer temperatures can already be scorching, conditions likely will be far more problematic, waterwise. Plus, there are major metropolitan areas, with political influence, already hoping to sink straws into water in the inland West and pipe it, like oil, to serve their needs.\n\nRunning scoffs at notions that spending millions of dollars in cloud seeding will make an appreciable difference against declining snowpacks. And, he chuckles at the irony that the same science-denying politicians who embrace manipulative cloud seeding reject the notion that human influence affects climate.\n\nWhen people talk about \u201cadaptation,\u201d he adds, many think of slow incremental\u2014i.e. orderly and measured\u2014responses to climate change, but events could force a more drastic, nonlinear response, particularly if climate change accelerates.\n\nThis could hasten something completely unplanned for\u2014environmental refuges ( read Jeff Goodell's piece in Rolling Stone ) involving people being forced to move closer to where the water is. The Greater Yellowstone region sits at the headwaters of three major river systems\u2014the Snake-Columbia; Yellowstone-Missouri-Mississippi; and Green-Colorado.\n\nAt stake is the very way we think and interact with the landscape around us. Here is just one minor touchstone; the city of Bozeman is rapidly racing toward the point where its water capacity, capable of serving the present population via Hyalite Reservoir and nearby tributaries will be maxed out. There may be pushes made to shore up more water storage capacity that could mean building more impoundments in mountain draws where streams presently flow wild and serve as the last refugia for native wild fish.\n\nWarmer temperatures, as mentioned earlier, mean less snow and more rain. \u201cThe snow season we currently have won\u2019t last as long and it will likely end abruptly,\u201d Whitlock said.\n\nTo most people, the changes are still almost imperceptible but it\u2019s the gradual deepening effects that could be transformative\u2014in the altered timing of runoff, the pollination of plants, when greenup happens, when trees die or burn, when humans are forced to give up what they used to do.\n\n\n\nIn March 2018, experts with the National Academies of Sciences released its Fourth National Climate Assessment , drawing upon thousands of studies from around the world. On the macro-level, the findings were stunning (see them at the end of this article).\n\n\u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0\n\nSki towns because of their location in the higher elevation will be hit hard. As one scientists told me, \u201cFor about seven generations, the thinking and identity of the rural West has sprung from its assumed relationship to water, the ability to manipulate it, count on it being there, and that\u2019s what had laid the groundwork for economic and social stability. You could set your watch by seasons. But half a century from now that will be gone, replaced by disruptions to routines and then abandoning of them.\u201d\n\nRegarding the future of winter, one of the experts sounding the alarm has a one-of-a-kind niche in the U.S. ski industry. He is concerned, in particular, about what awaits mountain communities. Auden Schendler works for one of the best-known outdoor snow sport corporations in the world, the Aspen Skiing Company.\n\nWhat Schendler and others describe as Greater Yellowstone\u2019s possible climate-related futureshock can be applied to other hamlets throughout the Rockies. \u201cClimate change isn\u2019t coming,\u201d Schendler explains. \u201cIt\u2019s already here; we\u2019re at the front-end now. But we can alter the future for those who will be looking back. The only question is: will they be praising us for taking action or cursing us for what we didn\u2019t do?\u201d\n\n\u201cClimate change isn\u2019t coming. It\u2019s already here; we\u2019re at the front-end now. The only question is: will our ancestors be praising us for taking action or cursing us for what we didn\u2019t do?\u201d \u2014 Auden Schendler\n\nAn ardent recreationist and a family man with bills to pay, Schendler has been called a cognitive dissident, conscientious objector, and, to ski destinations that want to keep pretending there isn\u2019t a problem of culpability, a gadfly. He actually gets paid to think defiantly about not only the connection between climate change and business but the relationship between economy and ecology\u2014and how the health of the latter supports the former.\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke vows to radically alter the management of public lands in the West, gutting environmental laws and unleashing an unprecedented push to extract oil, gas and coal in order to secure \u201cAmerican energy dominance,\" code for burning a lot of fossil fuels.\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke vows to radically alter the management of public lands in the West, gutting environmental laws and unleashing an unprecedented push to extract oil, gas and coal in order to secure \u201cAmerican energy dominance,\" code for burning a lot of fossil fuels.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has argued that climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese. U.S. Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, a dear friend of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, has notoriously asserted that climate change \u201cis the greatest hoax ever perpetuated on the American people.\u201d\n\nIn Wyoming, politicians at every government level, from school boards to state legislature, have moved to strike mention of climate change form text books and ordered the removal of art installations at the University of Wyoming addressing the impacts of climate on forests. Notably, the actual football field turf at the University of Wyoming is called The Jonah Field which honors the largest natural gas field in the state\u2014one that even former Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal said was a sacrifice zone for wildlife and an example of how not to develop fossil fuels. Yet that is exactly the kind of full-field development Zinke envisions.\n\nDuring an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News, U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who established her residency to run for office in the Jackson Hole town of Wilson, declared that \"the science [of climate change] is just simply bogus, you know, we know that temperatures have been stable for the last 15 years.\"\n\nClimate skeptics, however, cannot erase the data or the physical evidence rapidly mounting on the ground. If by \"stable\" Cheney means consistently rising temperatures, she is correct. Scientists with the National Academies note that, through last year, the last 17 years since the new millennium began were all counted among the hottest recorded in modern human times, except for one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne also wonders how much time Ms. Cheney has spent conversing with scientists from the National Academies or hiking the woods of Greater Yellowstone with ecologists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0\n\n\n\n\n\nYellowstone winterkeeper Steven Fuller, a Mountain Journal columnist who has spent 45 years in the center of America\u2019s first national park which, in turn forms the biological heart of Greater Yellowstone, has witnessed the changes firsthand. Wetlands where he took photographs two decades ago are dried up. Gone are the frogs and toads that used to be common. The fire season is two months longer, there\u2019s earlier melt out and there\u2019s a dearth of moose which he doesn\u2019t blame on wolves but drier landscape. [In Minnesota, moose declines are linked primarily to parasites now proliferating in and being passed along by white-tailed deer (doing better in a warmer climate) in addition to predation by wolves and rising temperatures].\n\n\u201cThe deep onset of winter in Yellowstone, the stretches of extreme cold, have become rarer and rarer,\u201d Fuller says. \u201cDeep cold brought a special feeling to the park interior. It used to last for months and it only happened a couple of days this year and it\u2019s getting briefer.\u201d Deep cold and a huge snowpack also favored species that evolved with it.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides being the senior vice president of sustainability for Aspen Snowmass, Schendler has served as board president of Protect Our Winters , a no-holds-barred nonprofit that has more than 130,000 supporters around the globe. Its primary target is first getting the ski industry and outdoor gear manufacturers to wake up, educate and mobilize hundreds of millions of outdoor sports enthusiasts around the world, then turn up the heat on Congress, governors, state houses and even local chambers of commerce.\n\nAuden Schendler, vice president of sustainability at Aspen Snowmass. Schendler and Protect Our Winters founder Jeremy Jones note that as the past few years have set global records as the warmest in modern times, more than a million square miles of snowpack\u2014 an area equal in size to three Texases\u2014that would ordinarily exist in spring has disappeared since 1970. The same as epic areas of sea ice cover in the Arctic north has shrunken back and the ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica are in accelerating melt or cracking off into the ocean.\n\n\u201cl ow snow years have negative impacts on the economy. We found that the increased skier participation levels in high snow years meant an extra $692.9 million in value added and 11,800 extra jobs compared to the 2001\u20132016 average. In low snow years, reduced participation decreased value added by over $1 billion and cost 17,400 jobs compared to an average season.\" In a 2018 report released by Protect Our Winters, researchers said,\n\nWhat happens when low snow years become chronic and when those dollars stop trickling through local economies? In Greater Yellowstone, nature-tourism related to just Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks is a $1 billion annual industry. Add in the commerce related to skiing, fishing, wildlife watching, recreation, hunting and guest lodges outside the parks and you can add a few billion dollars more, says Ray Rasker of Headwaters Economics. The health of nature also serves as the lucrative lynchpin of real estate. There's no better example than the ultra-exclusive Yellowstone Club in Big Sky that has its own private members-only ski area.\n\nI first met Schendler in 2014. I listened to him address the Jackson Hole SHIFT Festival on outdoor recreation, saying things about climate change the rest of his snowsports industry and purveyors of winter-oriented outdoor gear and apparel wouldn\u2019t touch. I was shocked not only by his clear articulation of the science, all of which was backed by studies, but also by his chutzpah. Schendler said things that no ski resort executive will or real estate broker. They make their livings on speculation, on self-interest and on short-term get-in-while-the getting-is-good kind of thinking.\n\nWere Schendler a federal employee working for the Trump Administration, saying the stuff that he shares would be liable to get one fired. But not only does he still have a job, and has been told by his boss that his back is covered, but his message, in spite of organized campaigns of disinformation spun to blunt it, is gaining traction. And most of all what he says is corroborated by science and what many are witnessing on the ground.\n\nA former reporter with High Country News, Schendler doesn\u2019t cloak his frustration with both the ski and larger outdoor recreation industries. When one thinks of all the fossil fuels burned to get skiers to western slopes, the amount of energy needed to operate the infrastructure and costs to heat second homes and buildings, it becomes clear it is one of the most carbon-intensive recreational pursuits.\n\nMany outdoor-recreation companies talk a good game but their actions, he says, actually amount to little more than greenwashing. In 2016, Schendler was asked to give a talk at the Outdoor Industry Association rendezvous in Denver. As he prepared his remarks, organizers wanted him to tone it down\u2014to focus not on swift attitude adjustments companies must make to slow climate change, but they wanted him to preach how business can still grow and thrive in a warming world.\n\nThey wanted him to paint a sanguine portrait, to suggest bullish investment conditions await for real estate in ski towns and to gloss over reality; they wanted him to tout better snowmaking, to say that the answer will simply be shifting the focus of outdoor recreation from winter to summer and shoulder seasons; they wanted him not to mention the ecological challenges that are coming for species that will be pushed to the edge. The Outdoor Industry Association wanted Schendler to basically say \u201cno worries\u201d and not utter anything negative about climate change because it\u2019s such a downer of a topic that neither the outdoor recreation industry nor the people it wants to sell products to want to hear. \u201cI told them, \u2018No. I won\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t sugar coat,\u2019\u201d Schendler said. They wanted Schendler to basically say \u201cno worries\u201d and not utter anything negative about climate change because it\u2019s such a downer of a topic that neither the outdoor recreation industry nor the people it wants to sell products to want to hear.\n\n\u201cI told them, \u2018No. I won\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t sugar coat,\u2019\u201d Schendler said. \u201cThat head-in-sand perspective is pervasive and it feeds into the perception that climate change is only a silly preoccupation of a radical fringe instead of being the greatest challenge for civilization of our time.\u201d\n\nIn my own reporting as an environmental journalist, what Schendler mentions above is pervasive and it goes well beyond some members of the outdoor recreation industry. It is also pandemic in the real-estate and development industries; the attitude is that whatever happens in the future will be left for people generations from now to contend with.\n\nIt includes some CEOs, who have vacation homes in Greater Yellowstone, who are afraid to weigh in on the side of science and won\u2019t go near the topic of actually discussing limits on human consumption/use of wildlands to better the prospects for wildlife. Why? Because they are afraid of losing clout in their political and social groups.\n\nAnd there are many non-governmental conservation organizations that are so afraid of possibly alienating funders in the non-profit world they won\u2019t touch the problems of climate change, industrial strength outdoor recreation and its impact on what remains of the wild West soon to come under a huge strain from climate-related impacts.\n\n\n\nWhat Schendler and others\u2014including former Black Diamond mountaineering CEO Peter Metcalf and Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard\u2014are advancing involves an operational question. It goes far beyond the bounds of existing balance sheets pertaining to investments in snowmaking, lift capacity, real estate, building warm season mountain biking trails to service growing numbers of warm-weather visitors or even believing that fortresses can be erected around exclusive gated communities to wall climate change out. Metaphorically, will the fortunes of ski areas in the future be turned to sand? Scientists say the snowsport industry's days of prominence, as we know them today, are numbered yet there remains stiff resistance to confronting the very issue that is causing its demise. NPS photo/Joseph Tumidalsky It\u2019s analogous to NASA, Schendler says, identifying that an asteroid is on a direct collision course with Earth. Yet unlike that scenario, climate change, he notes, is occurring and any hope of slowing its effects depends on a singular action: reducing the amount of carbon being pumped into the atmosphere. (It must be noted here that Patagonia is a supporter of Mountain Journal but there are no editorial connections between MJ and Patagonia. Indeed, the interview with Chouinard, below, happened before Mountain Journal was launched in August 2016).\n\n\u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0\n\nApart from rationalizing inaction on climate change, based on the argument that it comes with huge costs and requires all of us changing the way we live, Schendler says politicians, corporations and citizens also avoid addressing \u201cthe moral piece\u201d of responsibility to future generations. \u201cIt\u2019s really about how we want to live our lives, and what obligations we have as parents and citizens, even as job providers, to take big-picture steps to address the problem,\u201d he says, then invokes something profound. \u201cThe way to do that actually costs almost nothing, but carries risk and exposure: it\u2019s to use our voice and influence to speak out and force elected officials to move.\u201d\n\nThe National Ski Areas Association, representing more than 300 alpine resorts accounting for 90 percent of skier/snowboarder visits nationwide, has a program to reduce carbon emissions and recognizes the need to become more political around climate and to coerce member organizations into action, Schendler says.\n\nFor them, it is a survival issue. Given current carbon emissions and lack of action, climate change stands to render many of NSAA\u2019s member resorts no longer viable. Notably, Schendler added, Jackson Hole and Grand Targhee in Wyoming are on the list of \u201cclimate challengers\u201d taking modest action toward the ultimate goal of carbon neutrality. But Montana\u2019s Big Sky and Bridger Bowl are not.\n\nSchendler has brought along his boss, Mike Kaplan, CEO at Aspen, and Onno Wieringa, general manager at Utah\u2019s Alta who recently retired. Young people understand the urgency of climate change and they want to engage, he says; they just want to know how. They are willing to make sacrifices as long as they are spelled out and involve their elders sharing the burden. The Millennials/Gen Zers that Schendler talks to are also resentful of their Baby Boomer and Generation X parents and grandparents creating an epochal environmental problem that is theirs to inherit.\n\nClimate change is the greatest existential threat to the ski industry and merely believing the answer resides with tweaking a business model and becoming four season developments, is ignoring reality. Climate change is the greatest existential threat to the ski industry and merely believing the answer resides with tweaking a business model and becoming four season developments, is ignoring reality. In his travels across the West, trying to engage citizens, Schendler notes that young people want to work for companies that not only believe in diversity and sustainability but evince an environmental consciousness in their business practices. And he adds that companies demonstrating social responsibility are using it to attract smarter, more committed employees. \u201cPeople, especially those with children, want to work for companies doing the right thing,\u201d he told me.\n\nBusinessman Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and an outspoken promoter of sustainability, corporate altruism in addressing climate change, and healthy environments, is featured in the February 2018 edition of National Geographic with NatGeo 's Editor in Chief Susan Goldberg\n\nCompanies that are openly committed to environmental protection are attracting top-flight talent entering the workforce. When Goldberg asked Bloomberg what role big employers play in the environment, Bloomberg replied, \"Why will a corporation be environmentally friendly? Today, if you go and recruit on campus for the best and brightest, they [young people] interview you. They ask, What are you doing for the environment? Employees want to work for an environmentally-friendly company. And then there are investors. If you talk to the managers of the big pensions and endowments, they want socially responsible investing. We don't buy coal stocks, gun stocks, tobacco stocks.\"\n\nThe fact that snow will disappear beneath skis should actually be the least of worries for those in mountain towns, Schendler says. At the urging of Wieringa and Metcalf, 14 resorts in Utah sent a letter to Governor Gary Herbert in 2016 pointing out that 70 percent of Salt Lake City\u2019s drinking water comes from snowpack and 80 percent of the state\u2019s freshwater goes to farmers and ranchers. They also noted that by 2050, Utah\u2019s population is expected to double to 6 million. \u201cDo I find it a little ridiculous to be pondering whether we\u2019ll have a ski season 50 years from now given what other more serious priorities will be?\u201d Metcalf asks. \u201cCompletely. But whatever it takes. If businesses with the most engaged passionate audiences don\u2019t step forward, there\u2019s no hope.\u201d\n\nPeter Metcalf, photo courtesy Peter Metcalf As Schendler notes, Metcalf led the effort to move the Outdoor Retailer convention out of Utah based on the state\u2019s regressive land use policies. \u201cThat was a $100 million economic hit to the state, and boon to Denver,\u201d Schendler says. \u201cI told Peter that the rationale might as well be climate, too, ie, Utah is just as regressive on climate. But the outdoor industry has been scared to speak so overtly about climate. Public land issues are a lot safer and easier to take on as a cause. But climate change could not only dramatically negatively alter the experience people have on public lands, but it will bring major disruptions to economies that depend on them.\u201d\n\nOutdoor recreation in the U.S. is worth around $800 billion annually in consumer spending and it is responsible for creating 6.1 million direct jobs, according to the Outdoor Industry Association. In Montana alone, outdoor recreation generates $5.8 billion in consumer spending, $1.5 billion of which flows as employee wages to 64,400 jobs. It is responsible for more than $400 million annually in local and state taxes, which fund schools and other essential services.\n\nClimate-related disruptions are likely to hit Teton County, Wyoming hard. Jackson Hole's entire economy is dependent on various forms of outdoor recreation. Its eye-pleasing scenery\u2014besides generous tax laws in the state\u2014attract the uber wealthy who can live anywhere they want. In 2015, The Charture Institute commissioned a report titled \" The Coming Climate: Ecological and Economic Impacts of Climate Change on Teton County \".\n\nThe analysis was led by authors Corinna Riginos, a conservation scientist, and Mark Newcomb, who is today a Teton County Commissioner. The conclusions they reach are sobering in laying out profoundly traumatic consequences for both the natural environment and commerce.\n\n\u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0\n\nClarion calls, however, have been sounding for years. In 2006, climatologist James Hansen, now retired from his high-profile job with NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Columbia University\u2019s Earth Institute, said carbon-intensive business-as-usual would be a \u201cguarantee of global and regional disasters.\u201d\n\nA growing group of business people and prominent outdoor folk, from Metcalf to Chouinard and Todd Spaletto of North Face share Schendler\u2019s and Hansen\u2019s contentions. Corroborated by an irrefutable body of scientific evidence, they say human-caused climate change isn\u2019t an abstraction; harbingers can be found everywhere. It\u2019s only a matter of connecting the dots. Why the CEOs of other major outdoor retailers and manufacturers aren\u2019t more vocal is not only a mystery to Schendler but an abrogation of the kind of corporate social responsibility they purport to represent.\n\nMany people point to recent \u201cepic\u201d snow accumulation in the mountains, but the real issue, scientists says, is when and how fast it melts and disappears. In decades to come, moisture that gathers in the mountains will mostly come as rainfall that doesn\u2019t hold high into summer. In 2017, northern Montana in the vicinity of Glacier National Park had huge snow accumulations and yet the park\u2019s famous historic backcountry lodge, Sperry Chalet, burned in a summer wildfire.\n\nIn August 2016, I drove to interview coal-industry officials in Gillette, Wyoming\u2014hub of the Powder River Basin\u2014to write a story about the link between the burning of carbon-intensive fossil fuels in power plants and greenhouse gasses, more evidence was visible.\n\nGiant plumes of woodsmoke poured into the sky from forest fires burning in Yellowstone National Park, while along U.S. Interstate 90 the Yellowstone River had been abruptly closed to fishing and boating for 180 miles. The catalyst for the shutdown of outdoor recreation: an outbreak of a lethal kidney-destroying disease in thousands of whitefish linked to warm water and low flows in the Yellowstone.\n\nChoking smoke returned in the summer of 2017 to the valleys of western Montana and so did closures of streams due to low water causing stress on fish. A study showed that in 2017 some $400 million was spent fighting wildfires and the disruptive impacts cost Montana $240 million (yes, a quarter of a billion dollars) in lost visitor spending.\n\nDan Vermillion, a Livingston, Montana-based purveyor of global fly-fishing trips and chairman of the Montana Fish, Wildlilfe and Parks Commission, said scientists whom he consulted blamed it on climate change. From his office in the Yellowstone River town, Vermillion described the closure as a sobering wake-up call for the recreation industry, especially fly fishing, which is a potent engine for the regional economy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing events happen with a frequency we\u2019ve never experienced before,\u201d Vermillion said. \u201cThe closure on the Yellowstone was a costly biggie but in fact we\u2019ve been witnessing a rising number of user restrictions occurring on other rivers for half a decade.\u201d\n\nWhen the Yellowstone River was shut down for three weeks in 2016, Vermillion said that business at a fly shop he once owned in Livingston dropped 95 percent in three days. Later, the same parasitic pathogen that killed whitefish, proliferative kidney disease, turned up in seven other major trout rivers in and near Greater Yellowstone, renowned globally for its blue-ribbon streams. And it was found again in 2017.\n\nSome 40 percent of people who came to Montana in recent years for fishing did so in Park County (adjacent to Yellowstone Park), where the Yellowstone River flows out of its eponymous national park. By the 2060s as much as 70 percent of prime cold-water mountain habitat for trout could be gone. A recent study carried out by the U.S. Geological Survey showed that trout populations in seven major river basins are already exhibiting signs of stress.\n\nWhen Vermillion was a boy growing up in Billings, Montana, August was the prime month for fishing. \u201cNow I don\u2019t book in August because of the uncertainty over water. In my world every place we do business\u2014Mongolia, Brazil, the Bahamas, Alaska, British Columbia and Montana\u2014has seen dramatic changes in what used to be considered \u2018normal water.\u2019 Fishing seasons were designed around when we had the most stable water conditions but it\u2019s all getting out of whack. You create a negative perception and then people stop coming and pretty soon you have a domino effect caused by changing climate.\u201d A public land user stands at an overlook above the South Fork of the Snake River, a popular destination for global anglers. It's a sighing vision mirrored on the Yellowstone, Upper Missouri and other rivers that define the character of Greater Yellowstone, their persistence threatened by losing snow and no political will to address the cause. Photo courtesy Bureau of Land Management Vermillion has kids. He is frustrated. And refusing to sit idle he decided in 2018 to run for the Montana state legislature saying that confronting climate change is the only wise decision to protect the lifestyle and economy Montanans enjoy. He is profoundly frustrated by the attitudes of Zinke, U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, and U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte.\n\nEspecially in the case of Daines and Gianforte. Both of them claim to be promoters of the new economy driven by technology, informed by science, and yet they have become boosters, along with Zinke, of trying to revive a moribund coal industry that is directly linked to exacerbating the problems of climate change.\n\nVermillion wondered aloud: how can two elected officials who claim to be champions of science and technological innovation blatantly push to keep the state\u2019s economy tethered to forms of energy production that are outdated, pose a long-term threat to quality of life of their constituents and has been hobbled most, not by environmental regulations but a glut of natural gas?\n\nZinke and Pruitt, the EPA administrator, have done more than downplay climate change or dismiss its reality. They have taken actions to reduce funding for research into climate change, mute civil servants who speak publicly about it, sow a climate of fear within civil service ranks which is devastating morale, and they have moved to streamline policies that will result in even more carbon being jettisoned into the atmosphere.\n\nIronic is that Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead, who grew up on a ranch in Jackson Hole, has demonstrated limited leadership in fostering real discussion about the negative impacts bearing down on his state. He seems to have an aversion for anything that flows out of the mouths of environmentalists.\n\nIn fact, in 2016 he said Wyoming's strategy would be to \"double down\" in promoting coal production. In fairness, he's in a tough economic spot though never has Mead stood up to lawmakers in challenging the scientific illiteracy that is rampant in the Wyoming legislature.\n\n\u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0\n\nAfter I returned from Gillette, Wyoming, Chouinard was passing through Bozeman. He doubts that affluent Americans are willing to inconvenience themselves with necessary lifestyle modifications to confront climate change. He said humans narcissistically deflect and point fingers but we never reflect on our impacts or hold ourselves accountable. Those who consume the most resources ought to be vilified, not held up as role models.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re self-centered consumers not citizens concerned about a greater good,\u201d Chouinard said. \u201cWe\u2019re electing people who are actually voting against our survival. It\u2019s just like being an alcoholic and being in denial that you\u2019re an alcoholic. And until we face up to that, nothing\u2019s going to happen.\u201d He has made elevating awareness of climate change a major focus of Patagonia\u2019s marketing. \u201cWe\u2019re self-centered consumers not citizens concerned about a greater good. We\u2019re electing people who are actually voting against our survival. It\u2019s just like being an alcoholic and being in denial that you\u2019re an alcoholic. And until we face up to that, nothing\u2019s going to happen.\u201d \u2014Yvon Chouinard Zinke, experts say, needs to spend more time in the field with scientists who can show him concrete examples of change that is occurring beyond what is considered normal. What might he learn?\n\nOne point in this: even a seemingly small rise in average temperature can have big effects, ecologist Mike Tercek noted in a fairly recent special climate change edition of the journal Yellowstone Science . \u201cScientists predict that we will experience 3 to 8 degrees of warming in the next 100 years. In other words, the planet will experience about as much warming in the next 100 years as it did in the 8,000 years at the end of the last ice age, but this time it will be 30 to 80 times faster,\u201d he wrote.\n\nScientists with the National Academy of Sciences state that since 1979, climate change is to blame for half of the drying forests in the West, expanding wildfire areas by 16,000 square miles. In addition, research spelled out in a recent U.S. Department of Agriculture report said that for every couple of degrees the Fahrenheit rises, wildfire areas will quadruple in the West. And research notes that climate change is likely to result in more lightning\n\nProfessor Andrew Hansen, who oversees the Biodiversity Lab at Montana State University, was among four lead authors of a 2016 book, Climate Change in Wildlands , which offers a comprehensive overview of documented impacts and likely consequences for wild ecosystems. He recently elaborated on what it means for the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.\n\nAccording to Hansen, the number of days below zero F in Bozeman averaged 20 during the 1950s, yet 14 in the last decade and is trending toward fewer and fewer. And the decline in snowpack has reduced river flows by about 25 percent in the Yellowstone River since then. Due to the current low flows and warmer water temperatures, summer fishing restrictions are now the norm in rivers.\n\n\u201cI think the term climate change is more accurate than global warming,\u201d Vermillion says. \u201cOverall, things are warming and over decades that trend will prevail but in the meantime non-typical weather will be more profound, including oddly earlier and later snowstorms.\u201d\n\nIn spring 2017, it appeared that the Northern Rockies and high plains were well positioned with ample snowfall, but hot temperatures and no rainfall produced a \u201cflash drought\u201d in eastern Montana, punctuated by huge range fires. \"Those fires were huge and devastating to ranchers but they didn't seem to register around Bozeman,\" Whitlock said. Meanwhile, in the mountains, snowpack melted off fast and a lengthy fire season followed, cloaking the Gallatin Valley in thick unhealthy woodsmoke for more than a month.\n\nModels suggest that peak runoff will happen earlier in potentially short-term torrents of water and summers will begin with lower stream flows weeks ahead of the historic normal. \u201cLast year [2017] hit everybody by surprise but that kind of condition is more likely what you\u2019ll see in a future driven by warmer temperatures,\u201d Whitlock said.\n\n\u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0", "title": "For Yellowstone And America, Climate Change Brings Our Moment Of Truth"}, {"url": "http://www.ktvu.com/news/50-magnitude-earthquake-shakes-in-lake-county", "content": "- USGS has upgraded a recorded earthquake to a 5.1 magnitude from an initial 5.0.

Credit: University of Oklahoma A University of Oklahoma geophysics professor, Xiaowei Chen, details the foreshock activities leading up to the Pawnee earthquake, and highlights the complicated relationship between seismicity and wastewater injection rates in a research study published this week in Scientific Reports. The study details the precursory earthquake (foreshock) sequences that culminated in the September 3, 2016, 5.8 magnitude earthquake near Pawnee, Oklahoma, which ruptured along the previously unmapped Sooner Lake Fault.\n\n\"In this study, we sought to better understand the nucleation processes of large earthquakes in Oklahoma, with the focus on the triggering process of the Pawnee earthquake. We began with an overview of occurrence patterns of earthquakes in Oklahoma, and their relationship with injection zones. Then, we focused on Pawnee County with a detailed analysis of the relationship between injection and precursory activities, as well as stress interactions between magnitude 3 plus foreshocks and the mainshock,\" Chen said.\n\nChen, a professor in the OU School of Geology and Geophysics, led the study and collaborated with Nori Nakata, OU geophysics professor; Colin Pennington and Jackson Haffener, OU graduate students; Jefferson Chang and Jacob Walter, Oklahoma Geological Survey researchers; as well as collaborators Zhongwen Zhan, Caltech; and Sidao Ni and Xiaohui He, China. The study suggests that the Pawnee earthquake was a result of a complicated interplay among wastewater injection, faults and prior earthquakes in the region.\n\nWithin the broader Pawnee area, increased seismic activities started in 2014, but only until May 2016 did researchers detect microearthquakes in the immediate vicinity of the Pawnee magnitude 5.8 epicenter. The foreshocks from May to September 2016 occurred in two major episodes, and the seismicity rate correlates with wastewater injection rates from nearby wells. The pattern of foreshocks also reveals possible aseismic (or slow) slip near where the magnitude 5.8 occurred, which appears to drive foreshocks to \"migrate\" along the Sooner Lake Fault. Additionally, the three largest foreshocks were optimally-oriented so that their slip may have promoted failure along the Sooner Lake Fault.\n\nExplore further: Wastewater injection rates may have been key to Oklahoma's largest earthquake\n\nMore information: Xiaowei Chen et al.

These secondary shockwaves are usually less violent than the main quake but can be strong enough to do additional damage to weakened structures and can occur in the first hours, days, weeks, or even months after the quake.\n\nHelp injured or trapped persons. Remember to help your neighbors who may require special assistance such as infants, the elderly and people with access and functional needs. Give first aid where appropriate. Do not move seriously injured persons unless they are in immediate danger of further injury. Call for help.\n\nLook for and extinguish small fires. Fire is the most common hazard after an earthquake.\n\nListen to a battery-operated radio or television for the latest emergency information.\n\nBe aware of possible tsunamis if you live in coastal areas. These are also known as seismic sea waves (mistakenly called \"tidal waves\"). When local authorities issue a tsunami warning, assume that a series of dangerous waves is on the way. Stay away from the beach.\n\nUse the telephone only for emergency calls.\n\nGo to a designated public shelter if your home had been damaged and is no longer safe.

That quake was felt in Spokane and other areas around the Inland Northwest.\n\nSaturday's quake was reported at a depth of about 8.9 km, while Wednesday's was reported at a depth of 4.3 km.\n\nThe town of Lincoln has a population of about 1,000 people and is located about 30 miles northwest of Helena.\n\nFor more information, click here: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us1000985b#executive", "title": "Spokane, North Idaho News & Weather KHQ.com"}, {"url": "http://www.kxlf.com/story/35838823/earthquake-serves-as-reminder-about-being-prepared", "content": "Tuesday morning\u2019s earthquake near Lincoln didn\u2019t cause much structural damage. But it was a vivid reminder that the Helena area \u2014 along with the rest of Montana \u2014 is seismically active.\n\nThe magnitude 5.8 earthquake shook parts of Montana at 12:30 a.m. on Thursday; it was centered 5.5 miles southeast of Lincoln at a depth of about 2.6 miles, and was followed by several aftershocks, ranging from 3.1 to 4.9 in magnitude.\n\nIn addition to scores of reports from in and around Lincoln, reports have been received from Helena, Great Falls, Lewistown, Havre, Kalispell, Missoula, Butte, and beyond. The quake was felt as far away as Seattle, Washington, and Calgary, Canada.\n\nThere were no reports of injuries or major structural damage, but many businesses and homes had items shaken off of shelves and counters.\n\n\u201cThis is a teachable moment,\u201d said Paul Spengler, Lewis and Clark County\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Services coordinator.\n\nSpengler is taking the opportunity to share advice on how people can be ready in case of another quake.\n\n\u201cWhat you need to do is drop, duck, cover and hold,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring an earthquake, you should get under a table or other piece of sturdy furniture and hold on to it, staying away from the windows. If you can\u2019t get to any strong furniture, Spengler suggested turning onto your back and covering your head with your arms.\n\nThere were reports that some people ran out of their houses during Thursday\u2019s quake. Spengler said that\u2019s a mistake, as many of earthquake-related injuries come when people run outside.\n\n\u201cIt just takes one brick to fall off a building,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it hits you, it could be fatal or cause serious injury.\u201d\n\nHowever, once the shaking is over, Spengler said you should leave the building, in case any further aftershocks cause it to collapse.\n\nAnother piece of advice after an earthquake: Don\u2019t call 911 looking for information about the quake. Dispatchers need to be able to focus on emergency calls only.\n\nYou can take some of the most important precautions before the next earthquake happens. Large bookshelves should be anchored to the walls with metal brackets. Anything heavy should either be held in place with Velcro or put on a lower shelf.\n\n\u201cHeavy objects in high places become deadly missiles in an earthquake,\u201d Spengler said.\n\nSpengler said homeowners should know how to turn off utilities like water and gas \u2014 but never actually turn them He also encouraged homeowners to consider purchasing separate earthquake insurance, since many insurance policies won\u2019t include coverage for earthquake damage.\n\nSpengler also said everyone should put together an emergency kit, including non-perishable food and at least a gallon of water per person in the household. It should be enough to last for three or four days without utility services.\n\n\u201cIn a major earthquake, first responders are going to be swamped and are not going to be able to get to you as they would in a regular emergency,\u201d he said.\n\nOrganizations around Montana will be able to practice their earthquake preparedness this fall.

Jim Wells said with so many calls coming in, this could prevent someone who is in need of real help from getting it right away.\n\n\"Dispatchers know they are the first line of defense or help for anybody.

There were no reports of injuries or damage, though officials say 17,000 people reported feeling the 5.3 quake from as far away as Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nSoda Springs resident JoAnna Ashley was in nearby Georgetown visiting her parents when the biggest earthquake hit. She grabbed onto the shaking refrigerator and watched as a bottle of tiki torch fuel perched on top wobbled toward the edge. Her kids, ages 5 and 8, grabbed onto Ashley during the shaking.\n\n\"They didn't scream, but were all, 'Momma, what's happening?' in that worried voice,\" Ashley said.\n\nThe family spent the rest of the weekend camping, and they eventually started giggling whenever an aftershock would start rocking their camper.\n\n\"It kind of became commonplace. You'd be sitting there in the chairs, everyone talking, and all of a sudden you'd start to see the water shaking inside the bottle,\" she said.\n\nBy noon on Tuesday, more than 102 additional earthquakes had been recorded in the region by the U.S. Geological Survey, all at magnitudes of 4.5 or less.\n\nThey'll likely taper off by the end of next week, said John Bellini, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado. \"They can go on for days or weeks, and they'll get smaller in size and frequency,\" Bellini said.\n\nSmall magnitude earthquake swarms are common near the fault lines scattered throughout central and southeastern Idaho.\n\n\"Do we expect a larger one? No, we don't,\" said Bellini, though he noted that forecasting earthquake risk can be difficult.\n\n\"You don't have earthquakes every day like in California \u2014 they're feel-able just a few times a year in Idaho,\" he said. \"It's harder to make generalizations like that in areas that don't have as much seismicity.\n\nIdaho has had larger earthquakes in the past, but how often they repeat is not known.\"\n\nIdaho's biggest earthquake, a 6.9 temblor, was recorded on Oct. 28, 1983. The small towns of Challis and Mackay rocked for about a minute as the Lost River Fault beneath Borah Peak (Idaho's tallest mountain) pushed upward and the Thousand Springs Valley dropped.\n\nTwo schoolchildren were killed in that quake when a brick storefront collapsed. Aftershocks continued for more than a year \u2014 one reaching a magnitude of 5.8 \u2014 and the mountains and neighboring valley shifted nearly 14 feet apart in some places.\n\nAshley has experienced other earthquake swarms in the region, but she said the current one feels unusual because of the magnitude and frequency of the temblors.\n\n\"This is unprecedented for everybody. But if they say a bigger one is unlikely, then I think we'll all be fine,\" Ashley said. \"The only concern is that we'll get a big enough one to do damage \u2014 most of us here don't have earthquake insurance.\"", "title": "Earthquake swarm continues to rattle southeastern Idaho"}, {"url": "https://idahostatejournal.com/news/local/earthquakes-since-sept-over-quakes-have-struck-southeast-idaho-so/article_a16f6e7a-0cfe-575e-bd53-84810f1f8178.html", "content": "204 EARTHQUAKES SINCE SEPT. 2: Over 30 quakes have struck Southeast Idaho so far today as temblor swarm surpasses 200", "title": "204 EARTHQUAKES SINCE SEPT. 2: Over 30 quakes have struck Southeast Idaho so far today as temblor swarm surpasses 200"}, {"url": "https://idahostatejournal.com/news/local/three-earthquakes-hit-soda-springs-area-within-hours/article_0088ecec-aa6d-5cef-bab8-214eb41e88aa.html", "content": "You are the owner of this article.", "title": "Three earthquakes hit Soda Springs area within 24 hours"}, {"url": "http://www.cachevalleydaily.com/news/local/article_dce2a03a-0251-11e8-9373-ffa8be9b7539.html", "content": "An earthquake Thursday evening was felt by residents throughout northern Utah and southern Idaho.

And with being the first hijab-donning woman in a renowned hair label's campaign, she has added another achievement to her list. \"A world of care for your hair\", is one of the recurring lines for the campaign on the L'Or\u00e9al Paris website.

She said, \"I think seeing a campaign like this would have given me more of a sense of belonging\".\n\nBut her hair is very definitely a huge part of her identity.\n\nMeanwhile, some people found the whole campaign to be a bit amusing, considering that the model's hair isn't visible under the hijab, so the new L'Oreal product might not even be effective for the beauty of the locks of hair.
