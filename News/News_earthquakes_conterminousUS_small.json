You have to be close.\" In April 2011, renowned photojournalist Chris Hondros got too close. He was killed in the same mortar attack in the rebel-held Libyan town of Misrata that took the life of Oscar-nominated British film-maker and photographer Tim Hetherington.\n\nGetty Images\n\nHondros is the subject of a new documentary film, directed by fellow journalist and childhood friend Greg Campbell, who he worked alongside in Kosovo, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Campbell was with Hondros in Libya until just a week before the mortar attack that ended his life.\n\nCampbell takes viewers on a global journey to meet the people in Hondros's most influential photographs, uncovering their little-known backstories.\n\nHondros shot to fame during the 2003 Liberian civil war, with a photograph of government commander Joseph Duo celebrating after firing an RPG at rebel positions near a contested bridge in Monrovia. Hondros went back to Liberia after the civil war. He tracked down Duo and paid for his college tuition.\n\nChris Hondros/Getty Images\n\nHondros was driven to find the human angle of war photography. His photo of a young Iraqi girl crying after her parents were accidentally shot as they drove through a U.S. checkpoint led to worldwide outrage and a change in U.S. military protocols. The film follows in Hondros' footsteps as he returns to Iraq to find out what happened to the girl in the photo.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nChris Hondros/Getty Images\n\nCampbell says: \"Chris\u2019 skills as a photojournalist were matched only by the humanity he displayed in every situation. After studying so many of his photos in producing the film, I noticed his tendency to shoot humane moments amid turbulent events, particularly with children who were caught up in the wars that he covered. It wasn\u2019t until we began shooting in the many places where he left his footprints that we were able to see just how much of a lasting impact he had had on so many people who remember him fondly.\n\n\"I always thought we would have plenty of time to hear the stories of his career, of his famous photographs, and of the people he met and befriended, often during the most extreme situations of their lives, but when he was killed in Misrata, Libya in April 2011, the chance to better understand him and his experiences died as well.\n\n\"Directing this film gave me the opportunity to learn \u2013 as much as was possible \u2013 about the life Chris led behind the lens, and about the impact he had on people living far from the comforts that most of us are used to.\"\n\nAn annual award for photojournalism has been set up in Hondros's name. It continues his legacy of creating a visual history through his distinctive ability to bring shared human experiences into the public eye.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one of these people who got into war photography for the rush,\" Hondros said. \"I believe in the role that journalists\u2014and photographers specifically\u2014play in the whole system of international conflict.\"\n\nOver the last decade of his life, the US-born photographer covered some of the world's major conflict zones, including Liberia, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Iraq, Haiti and\u2014ultimately\u2014Libya.

The Texas primaries are Tuesday. (Eric Gay/AP)\n\nWith Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve.\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: The first primaries of 2018 in Texas on Tuesday could set the tune for six months of Democratic infighting.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has been taking fire from the left since publishing opposition research on Laura Moser, a progressive candidate in a crowded Democratic primary field to take on Rep. John Culberson (R). The campaign arm for House Democrats concluded that Moser could not win the general election in a suburban Houston district that Hillary Clinton narrowly carried. Among other things, she wrote a piece for Washingtonian magazine in 2014 that said she\u2019d \u201csooner have my teeth pulled out without anesthesia\u201d than move to her grandparents\u2019 home in rural Texas.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez does not think the DCCC should have publicized that information. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d he told me and USA Today\u2019s Susan Page in an interview that aired Sunday for C-SPAN\u2019s \u201cNewsmakers\u201d series. \u201cWe\u2019re at our best as Democrats when we talk about the issues. \u2026 I don\u2019t believe we should be anointing candidates. The people in Texas are the people who should be making the choices in Texas.\u201d\n\nThe public split showcased the diverging priorities of the party committees. The DCCC is willing to play the role of bad cop because leaders think it\u2019s the only way to pick up the 24 seats needed to win the House majority. The DNC, which Perez has now led for a year, is trying to restore trust that was lost in the national party during the contentious 2016 nominating contest between Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cOne thing we\u2019ve learned at the DNC is that when you, in fact or in perception, are trying to put the thumb on the scale in a spirited primary, that can undermine public confidence in us,\u201d said Perez. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve been neutral.\u201d\n\nLaura Moser picks up campaign materials at a print shop in Houston. (Michael Stravato for the Washington Post)\n\nA constellation of liberal groups \u2014 from Justice Democrats and CREDO to the Sanders-aligned Our Revolution \u2014 launched online petitions last week telling DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n to \u201cstop attacking progressives.\u201d\n\nThe DCCC anticipated this blowback. The veteran operatives who work there could have easily placed each of the \u201coppo hits\u201d on Moser in the press with no fingerprints attached. The fact they didn\u2019t was as significant as the underlying content of the message. They were sending a signal about their willingness to wade into crowded primaries and gauging the reaction from the left as they plot strategy for looming primary fights.\n\nThese operatives expect that it will be imperative to intervene in California, where a jungle primary system means that the top two finishers in June will face each other in November, regardless of their party. If there are bunches of Democrats splitting the vote, that could allow two Republicans to make it to the runoff.\n\n\u201cAs we've indicated all cycle, the DCCC is keeping all options on the table to work with our allies and ensure that there's a competitive Democrat on the ballot for voters to elect in November,\u201d Meredith Kelly, the DCCC\u2019s communications director, said on Sunday.\n\nRepublicans are hopeful that record numbers of Democratic primary candidates will lead to squabbling and push the eventual nominees to the left in places like Texas\u2019s Seventh District. The Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC backed by Speaker Paul Ryan, has been looking for opportunities to sow division. On Friday, the group published internal polling that showed Moser gaining since the DCCC\u2019s attacks.\n\nDNC Chairman Tom Perez participates in a Daily 202 Live event last year. (Kristoffer Tripplaar for The Washington Post)\n\nTalking with Democrats over the weekend about the appropriateness of wading into primaries sparked a sense of deja vu because I had almost identical conversations with strategists at the Republican committees and outside groups when they were out of the White House. Republicans blew a lot of winnable races during the Obama years because unelectable candidates prevailed in primaries, from Christine O\u2019Donnell and Sharron Angle in 2010 to Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock in 2012. Allies of Mitch McConnell became more aggressive in 2014, and it helped him become majority leader. On the other hand, going after tea partyers earned the enmity of the base \u2014 and helped lead to disenchantment with the party establishment that allowed for the rise of Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nJust like his Republican counterparts used to, Perez argued that heated primaries make his party stronger. He noted that Ralph Northam won the Virginia governor\u2019s race last November despite facing a credible primary challenge from former congressman Tom Perriello on his left.\n\n\u201cEverybody who went to the polls felt like they had a fair shake, and their candidate had a fair shake,\u201d said Perez. \u201cIt has increased turnout and it has really put wind at our back going into general elections. \u2026 We have to be careful not to confuse unity with unanimity.\u201d (Watch the full half-hour interview here.)\n\nBecause the DNC is staying on the sidelines, the DCCC is becoming a sort of boogeyman on the left. A black Democratic candidate in Pennsylvania last week even accused the committee of trying to nudge him out of the race in favor of white candidates, which the party denied. (Dave Weigel has more on that.)\n\nSigns point to an early voting location in San Antonio. (Eric Gay/AP)\n\n-- Against the backdrop of this intraparty wrangling, there is growing evidence of especially strong Democratic enthusiasm:\n\nFor example, a record number of candidates are running for Congress this year. Paul Kane pulled the numbers for his Sunday column: \u201cBy Dec. 31, 2017, more than 2,100 people had taken at least the first step toward running for the House or Senate by filing the necessary paperwork, according to records kept by the Federal Election Commission. For context, that\u2019s almost twice as many candidates who launched congressional campaigns in 2015. It represents the most candidates at this stage of the election season since the FEC started keeping these records, in 1977. \u2026\n\n\u201cBy Dec. 31, some 1,133 candidates had filed to run as Democrats for House seats, easily the largest crop either party has ever assembled at that point of an election cycle. Even Republicans, with 689 declared candidates for the House in 2017, have their second-largest field ever, trailing only 2009. That massive crop of 745 candidates, the second-largest ever for any party, set the stage for the 2010 midterm wave that delivered Republicans the House majority.\u201d\n\nIn Texas alone, there are 111 House candidates. For the first time in 25 years, at least one Democrat is running in all 36 of the state\u2019s congressional district. In 2016, the party didn\u2019t even field a challenger against eight GOP incumbents. \u201cOn a state legislative level, Democrats have candidates in 132 of the 150 state House districts and in 14 of the 15 state Senate districts up for election this year,\u201d NPR\u2019s Jessica Taylor notes. \u201cThat includes four Senate districts where Democrats didn't field candidates in 2014 or 2012, and 20 new House districts where they didn't have candidates in either 2016, 2014 or 2012.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks largely to a huge surge in Democratic turnout, Texans in the 15 largest counties have smashed the record for early voting in a non-presidential year,\u201d Jonathan Tilove reports in today\u2019s Austin American-Statesman. \u201cWhile there is no necessary correlation between primary and general election turnout, more than twice as many people voted early in the Democratic primaries in 2018 as in 2014, while Republican early voting crept up by 15 percent \u2026 Early voting this year in the Democratic contests was so high in Travis County [which includes Austin] that it slightly exceeded participation in 2016, a presidential year.\u201d\n\nRep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) deplanes from Air Force One with President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama in 2013. (Josh Reynolds/AP)\n\n-- The primary season that begins tomorrow will not wrap up until September, when Massachusetts, Delaware, New Hampshire, New York and Rhode Island vote. (See the full calendar here.)\n\nPurity tests could become a problem during the long stretch between now and then. A story on the front page of today\u2019s New York Times notes that even Rep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) is facing a serious primary challenge from his left in Boston. \u201cMr. Capuano, who is serving his 20th year in Congress, is a down-the-line progressive \u2026 But he has stirred a challenge from Ayanna Pressley, the first black woman elected to the Boston City Council,\u201d Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin report. \u201cIn a district once held by John F. Kennedy and Tip O\u2019Neill, where college campuses abound and minority communities now make up most of the population, Ms. Pressley argues that voters should demand an activist lawmaker who is more than a \u2018reliable vote.\u2019 In an unusual show of deference to Ms. Pressley, two of the state\u2019s highest-profile Democrats, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Seth Moulton, said they would stay neutral rather than back their colleague in Congress. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III \u2026 is behind Mr. Capuano.\u201d\n\nThe 66-year-old incumbent has voted twice to impeach Trump, but he could still lose anyway. \u201cMy district is upset,\u201d Capuano said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like the Donald Trump agenda, and I\u2019ve been as vocal as I can be.\u201d\n\nFolks attend a Republican congressional candidate forum in New Braunfels, Tex. (Eric Gay/AP)\n\n-- But while Democrats face pressure to lurch left, Republicans feel like they must wholeheartedly embrace Trump to win a GOP primary in this environment. Mike DeBonis and Eva Ruth Moravec report on the crowded GOP primaries in Texas: \u201cOne candidate\u2019s campaign signs declare \u2018MAGA,\u2019 referencing Trump\u2019s mantra of \u2018Make America Great Again.\u2019 Another\u2019s is promising to \u2018drain the swamp\u2019 and plays up his ties to a key Trump political adviser. And another\u2019s promises to \u2018Make America Like Texas,\u2019 a slogan spelled out in the Trump campaign\u2019s signature font. \u2026 With some notable exceptions, candidates in one especially raucous Republican primary \u2014 the 18-person contest to fill the 21st District seat being vacated by Rep. Lamar Smith \u2014 have been wary of showing any daylight between their position and Trump\u2019s. \u2018I think if you\u2019re not with the president, you\u2019re not going to have a chance of winning this race,\u2019 said Jason Isaac, a state representative who is running for the seat.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n-- \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d took home Best Picture at an Oscars that was rife with political moments. Dan Zak and Monica Hesse report: \u201c\u2018I think that the greatest thing our art does, and our industry does, is erase the lines in the sand,\u2019 said the winning film\u2019s creator, Guillermo del Toro, whose victory for best director was the fourth time in the past five years that a Mexican filmmaker took home that prize. \u2018We should continue doing that, when the world tells us to make them deeper.\u2019 The industry confronted its own mistreatment of women, and defied the isolationist and nationalist tone set by President Trump, in between doling out golden statuettes \u2014 which went to a wide spectrum of films, including the horror film \u2018Get Out,\u2019 whose writer-director Jordan Peele became the first black filmmaker to win best original screenplay, and the World War II action film \u2018Dunkirk,\u2019 which scooped up three technical awards.\u201d\n\nThere were many references to the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements: \u201c[Best Actress winner Frances McDormand] asked all the female nominees in the audience to stand. \u2018Okay, look around everybody, look around ladies and gentlemen,\u2019 McDormand said to a cheering audience. \u2018Because we all have stories to tell and projects we need financed. Don\u2019t talk to us about it at the parties tonight; invite us into your office in a couple days.\u2019 Nearly two and a half hours into the ceremony, three women who\u2019ve accused Weinstein of sexual abuse took the stage: Salma Hayek Pinault, Ashley Judd and Annabella Sciorra.\u201d\n\nHere is the complete list of winners.\n\n-- Host Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s jokes nodded to Hollywood\u2019s sexual misconduct scandals, Trump and Fox News.

(Andreas Solaro/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n-- Siren from Rome: The populist contagion has infected Italy. \u201cItalian populists of all leanings took a hammer to their country\u2019s old political order in Sunday elections, crushing traditional centrist parties in favor of a kaleidoscope of alternatives on the left and right and upending their former system,\u201d Michael Birnbaum reports from Rome. \u201cThe vote plunged Europe\u2019s fourth-largest economy into an uncertainty unique even to a nation known for cycling through leaders at a rapid clip. The shattering of the political landscape ruled out most plausible alliances among parties. But voters did not offer a clear direction for the future as they struggle with a stagnating economy and an influx of migrants, even as more than half voted for anti-establishment parties.\n\n\u201cThe surging outsider Five Star Movement captured more voters than any other party, about 32 percent, according to projections based on initial vote counts, meaning it is likely to play a key role in any governing coalition. In an extraordinary result, it appeared to have won nearly as many votes as the mainstream center-left and center-right parties combined. Italy\u2019s complicated electoral system could lead to initial results shifting slightly, but politicians of all stripes were treating the first projections as an earthquake.\n\n\u201cThe election drew the attention of anti-establishment crusaders from around the world, who saw the roiling populist energy of the campaign as a harbinger for other European nations. \u2026 Stephen K. Bannon was among the people who traveled to Rome to see the final days of the campaign. Formerly fringe ideas, such as deporting 600,000 migrants who have come to Italy without proper papers in recent years, have entered the mainstream.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cThe contours of the new regime are still unclear, but an old one is certainly passing,\u201d Ishaan Tharoor writes in his WorldViews newsletter. \u201cIn the weeks ahead, Italy's populists and ultranationalists will have to reckon with the actual prospect of taking power.\u201d\n\nGET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b\n\nThe nor\u2019easter that pounded the East Coast over the past few days claimed eight lives.

Jon Tester (Mont.) and Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), seen here with President Trump last year, support rolling back Dodd-Frank. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nTHE DECONSTRUCTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE:\n\n-- \u201cThe Senate is preparing to scale back the sweeping banking regulations passed after the 2008 financial crisis, with more than a dozen Democrats ready to give Republicans the votes they need to weaken one of President Barack Obama\u2019s largest legislative achievements,\u201d Erica Werner and Damian Paletta report. \u201cCongress\u2019s appetite for pulling back bank regulations shows the renewed clout of the financial sector in Washington, not just in the GOP but also among Democrats. Eight years after nearly every Senate Democrat backed a sweeping set of new rules for financial firms large and small, the party is now split, with moderates, several of them facing tough midterm election contests, working with the opposing party.\n\n\u201cThe core of the new bill exempts about two dozen financial companies with assets between $50 billion and $250 billion from the highest levels of scrutiny by the Federal Reserve \u2026 Supporters argue that the legislation would bring much-needed relief to midsize and regional banks that were treated like their much larger counterparts under the 2010 legislation known as Dodd-Frank. Opponents say it would weaken the oversight needed to stave off the type of dangerous lending and investing that brought the U.S. economy to its knees. The Senate is slated to take an initial procedural vote this week to move the measure forward, and if it eventually becomes law [as expected], it would be the most substantial weakening of Dodd-Frank since it was passed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the 10th anniversary of an enormous financial crash, Congress should not be passing laws to roll back regulations on Wall Street banks,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). \u201cThe bill permits about 25 of the 40 largest banks in America to escape heightened scrutiny and to be regulated as if they were tiny little community banks that could have no impact on the economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), a Banking Committee member and one of the new bill\u2019s leading Democratic supporters, said banks in his largely rural state have been going out of business in part because of the regulations imposed by Dodd-Frank. \u2026 Financial firms upped their campaign contributions to key Senate Democrats over the last year, with [Heidi] Heitkamp, [Joe] Donnelly and Tester becoming the top three Senate recipients of donations from commercial banks so far in the 2018 campaign cycle \u2026 Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who represents Wall Street and is often motivated by the desire to protect his vulnerable red-state incumbents, opposes the bill, but he has taken a largely hands-off approach to the debate thus far.\u201d\n\nThe offices of a shuttered coal operation are abandoned in Hi Hat, Ky.

Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nA WINDOW INTO HOW WASHINGTON WORKS:\n\n-- Boston Globe A1, \u201cZombie agencies are nearly impossible to kill,\u201d by Annie Linskey: \u201cShortly after taking office, (Trump) identified 19 little-known federal offices for elimination. But despite his efforts to do away with what he sees as government waste, the bureaus are all still living, breathing, and spending taxpayer dollars. \u2026 From regional development commissions to arts councils, to offices responsible for fostering foreign aid, all these bureaus have continued their work ...\n\n\u201cA case study of sorts in bureaucratic survival is illustrated by the Appalachian Regional Commission, one of the agencies Trump initially wanted to get rid of last year. This roughly $150 million program might seem like an obvious place to slice. \u2026 As it turns out, the Appalachian Regional Commission has a lot going for it that might not be apparent at first glance. It crosses 13 state boundaries. In Washington math, that means 26 senators have a reason to care about it. (Twenty-three of those 26 senators voted to keep it alive, including 15 Republicans.) One of states served by the commission is Kentucky, which is home to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. In January Trump nominated one of McConnell\u2019s top staffers, Tim Thomas, to be the federal cochairman of the commission. This year, Trump didn\u2019t suggest eliminating the agency. It\u2019s off the kill list.\u201d\n\nTHE REST OF TRUMP'S AGENDA:\n\n-- \u201cTrump says American workers are hurt by immigration.

Their corner of northern Texas has been culturally and economically transformed, and they had never had an American president say the transformation was a bad thing. And yet, no one seemed to believe the Cactus plant would be filled anytime soon with American workers. People here were not even sure they were American jobs in the first place. At least not since the Vietnamese and Laotians showed up in the late 1970s, a few years after the plant opened.\u201d\n\n-- Administration officials sent mixed signals about the president\u2019s aluminum and steel tariffs on the Sunday shows. From Anne Gearan and Karoun Demirjian: \u201cWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro appeared to draw a firm line against case-by-case exemptions as he defended President Trump's sudden imposition of new trade premiums, which are likely to hit Canada and Europe hardest. \u2026 \u2018As soon as he starts exempting countries, he has to raise the tariff on everybody else,\u2019 the adviser said [on Fox News] when asked about Canada and the European Union. \u2026 In a separate interview on CNN, Navarro suggested Trump could indeed grant exceptions if doing so would serve U.S. interests. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that although he does not expect Trump to change his mind, he does not rule it out.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s constantly shifting policy positions have left congressional Republicans feeling directionless. John Wagner and Seung Min Kim report: \u201cThe legislative standoffs on guns and immigration have also underscored a larger reality about Trump\u2019s relationship with Capitol Hill: ... He has been unable to score a major legislative victory on any issue that was not already a leading priority of Republican lawmakers. \u2026 Trump\u2019s policy inconsistencies are sure to complicate and even stymie whatever legislative agenda he has this year, leaving a vacuum of policy details that lawmakers then attempt to fill.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson attends the Ministerial Meeting of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS in Kuwait City, Kuwait. (Noufal ibrahim/EPA-EFE)\n\nTHERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- The State Department has spent none of the $120 million it was allocated to combat election interference by foreign actors, reports the New York Times\u2019s Gardiner Harris. \u201cAs a result, not one of the 23 analysts working in the department\u2019s Global Engagement Center \u2014 which has been tasked with countering Moscow\u2019s disinformation campaign \u2014 speaks Russian, and a department hiring freeze has hindered efforts to recruit the computer experts needed to track the Russian efforts. \u2026 [T]he funding lag reflects a deep lack of confidence by Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson in his department\u2019s ability to execute its historically wide-ranging mission and spend its money wisely. Mr. Tillerson has voiced skepticism that the United States is even capable of doing anything to counter the Russian threat.\u201d\n\n-- The State Department\u2019s 2019 budget calls for slashing funds for the National Endowment for Democracy, reports Josh Rogin. \u201c[The budget would also] disassemble [NED\u2019s] relationships with its core institutes, including the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute. For the NED and those institutes, the proposal is an assault not only on their organizations but also on the pro-democracy mission they are dedicated to. \u2026 The proposal initially came out of the Office of Management and Budget, even though the State Department did not formally ask for it. A senior OMB official told me the administration supports the NED\u2019s mission but wants to consolidate the funding streams to improve oversight and accountability. But the White House didn\u2019t provide any evidence that the current model is inefficient.\u201d\n\n-- In a closed-door speech, Trump praised China for ditching presidential term limits. From Amanda Erickson: \u201c[While speaking to Republican donors at Mar-a-Lago] on Saturday, Trump joked about the term-limits move, saying Xi is now \u2018president for life. President for life. No, he's great. And, look, he was able to do that. I think it's great.\u2019 \u2018Maybe we'll have to give that a shot someday,\u2019 Trump went on.\u201d\n\n-- Obama\u2019s former chief of staff Denis McDonough blamed Mitch McConnell for watering down language about Russian election interference in a letter to states about protecting their voting systems. From Karoun Demirjian: \u201cMcDonough complained on NBC\u2019s [\u2018Meet the Press\u2019] that members of Congress have shown a \u2018stunning lack of urgency about this question,\u2019 and he put the blame mostly on Republican leaders in Congress. \u2018The lack of urgency that we saw from the Republican leadership in 2016, we continue to see to this day today,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s beyond time for Congress to work with the administration, to work with the states, to ensure that our electoral systems are ready to go. This is not a game.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Axios obtained a grand jury subpoena that special counsel Robert Mueller's team recently sent to a witness in its Russia probe. The subpoena requests all communications the witness sent or received regarding Carter Page, Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump, Hope Hicks, Keith Schiller, Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, Roger Stone and Steve Bannon from November 1, 2015 (five months after Trump announced his presidential bid) to the present.\n\nFLORIDA FALLOUT:\n\n-- The Florida Senate rejected a ban on assault-style weapons and advanced plans to arm teachers in proposals on school safety. The Miami Herald\u2019s Mary Ellen Klas, Steve Bousquet and Lawrence Mower report: \u201cThe Senate is expected to approve the measure Monday and send it to the House, where leaders there hope to approve it in time for it to reach the governor\u2019s desk before the session ends on March 9 ... The Senate rejected nearly four dozen Democratic amendments ... The four-part package focuses on mental health, firearms safety, school safety and communication and includes what [one Republican lawmaker] said was \u2018the most frequent request\u2019 \u2014 to raise the age for buying a rifle or shotgun from 18 to 21.\u201d\n\n-- Senators from both parties urged Trump to take a leading role in crafting gun-control legislation. From Karoun Demirjian: \u201c\u2018He can set his legacy: President Trump coming forth to something like this and putting his support behind will give Republicans enough cover to support this,\u2019 said Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.)[.] \u2026 But the senator cautioned against adding a provision to ban semiautomatic weapons, such as the AR-15, to that bill. \u2026 Manchin also endorsed a new effort from Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) that would let police or relatives of an individual who shows \u2018red flags\u2019 to petition the court to seize that person\u2019s firearms. \u2026 \u2018The president did a good job talking about \u2014 we should be able to do something to stop shootings like this,\u2019 Graham said.\u201d\n\n-- Senators facing tough reelections have been conspicuously silent in the gun debate. From the AP\u2019s Steve Peoples. \u201cThey often choose strategic silence rather than get crosswise with the National Rifle Association\u2019s die-hard supporters on the right or the growing movement of passionate gun control advocates on the left. The office of Nevada\u2019s senior senator, Republican Dean Heller, would not say why did he did not attend the White House meeting. Heller \u2026 has avoided the spotlight in the subsequent days as well, declining to address specifics about his positions on gun legislation. \u2026 North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, both Democrats running for reelection in states Trump won handily, have said nothing about gun violence from the Senate floor in recent days, but made statements honoring constituents who had recently passed away.\u201d\n\n-- A gun show in a conservative Chicago suburb banned sales of AR-15s. Mark Guarino reports: \u201cOrganizers halted an advertised raffle that would have awarded an AR-15 to the winner, and vendors were told they would not be allowed to sell the weapon at the monthly show. Frank Cesare \u2014 of the Pioneer Valley Sportsman\u2019s Association, which has hosted the show for more than 40 years \u2014 said the decision followed complaints the group received after the Parkland shooting and as gun-control advocates planned to protest. \u2026 Cesare said that the ban on AR-15s also would remain in place for April\u2019s show and that the club is \u2018waiting to see\u2019 what the mood is like before deciding on shows later in the year.\u201d\n\n-- Former Ohio attorney general Marc Dann (D) wrote an op-ed for the Cleveland Plain Dealer entitled, \u201cWhy I regret being in the pocket of the NRA:\u201d \u201cUnlike other special interests that exert influence by making campaign contributions, the gun groups spend the blood money they collect from gunmakers to misinform and then motivate voters who care about a single issue: the sanctity of the Second Amendment. \u2026 Anyone who thinks Social Security is the third rail of American politics has clearly never talked about firearms with an NRA member. While I didn't enter politics to be an advocate for the NRA, I quickly learned that unless I became one, I wouldn't be around to advocate for the issues I did care about. So I made a devil's bargain with myself: To stay in office, I adopted pro-gun positions that made me uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nThe president, accompanied by the first lady, waves to members of the media as they arrive Saturday at Andrews Air Force Base. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nWEST WING INTRIGUE:\n\n-- Trump has become increasingly isolated as the White House weathers a series of controversies. From Politico\u2019s Nancy Cook and Andrew Restuccia. \u201c[A]s president, he rarely comes into contact with regular people except in the structured setting of the White House or during tightly orchestrated events set up by staff[.] \u2026 It\u2019s another way that Trump has obliterated the norms of the presidency, according to interviews with more than 20 current and former White House officials, Trump friends and close advisers. Rather than trying to project an air of accessibility, Trump has unapologetically stuck to his insular White House life, avoiding and more or less eliminating the optics of the president appearing in public as a citizen. The approach keeps Trump in his comfort zone but makes it harder for him to do the work of being president[.]\u201d\n\n-- HUD Secretary Ben Carson reportedly considered quitting amid recent budget battles. The New York Times\u2019s Glenn Thrush reports: \u201c\u2018There are more complexities here than in brain surgery,\u2019 Mr. Carson said in an interview last week. \u2018Doing this job is going to be a very intricate process.\u2019 \u2026 While Mr. Trump treats him with respect, he views him as a beta \u2018winner,\u2019 not as a \u2018killer,\u2019 the alpha in his organizational taxonomy, according to several White House officials. That lack of influence was painfully apparent during the internal debate before the release of Mr. Trump\u2019s budget, which would help pay for increases in military and Homeland Security spending with steep cuts to HUD\u2019s Community Development Block Grant and core housing programs. \u2026 In private, \u2026 Mr. Carson has been profoundly frustrated, telling friends he would find it difficult to stay if deep cuts to two housing programs, focused on helping the elderly and the disabled, were enacted.\u201d\n\n-- As other high-profile Trump advisers have left exited, Kellyanne Conway has managed to hold on. The New York Times\u2019s Katie Rogers and Maggie Haberman write: \u201cIn a White House with the highest turnover rates in decades, she has survived by knowing when to step back from the spotlight, keeping the president\u2019s ear, focusing on a policy issue significant to the poor and working class, and maintaining an unflinching loyalty to President Trump even as she outmaneuvers rivals on the staff. The public criticism hasn\u2019t abated, but Ms. Conway\u2019s skin is thicker than it used to be. \u2026 [O]ne of her biggest strengths, those who know her say, is that she has always understood whom she works for. Loyalty to her clients always came easily, but this time, her client just happens to be in the Oval Office.\u201d\n\n-- A group of Trump superfans greet him as he crosses a bridge every time he visits Mar-a-Lago. Lori Rozsa reports: \u201cThey call themselves the Bridge Family. \u2026 They\u2019re connected by a fanaticism for the president \u2014 and by their willingness to show up whenever they hear that his motorcade will cross the Southern Boulevard Bridge. \u2026 On the other side of the street, about a dozen protesters waved signs reading \u2018Corruption\u2019 and \u2018Impeach.\u2019 But on the side the president could see, it was all fans \u2014 about 60 of them[.] \u2026 He\u2019s been known to stop the motorcade and jump out of his armored SUV to greet fans on the bridge. And last year, in March and December, he ordered his staff to bring some of the Bridge Family to Mar-a-Lago.\u201d\n\nDemonstrators hold a sit-in outside the White House during the People's Climate Movement in April. (Eric Thayer/Bloomberg News)\n\nMORE ON THE MIDTERMS:\n\n-- A recently founded PAC is helping scientists run for office. Ben Guarino and Laurie McGinley report: \u201cNamed for the first three digits of pi, 314 Action describes itself as the vanguard of \u2018the pro-science resistance.\u2019 The group\u2019s founder, Shaughnessy Naughton, said 7,000 people have responded to the group\u2019s call to run for office. The group has also assembled a network of about 400,000 donors eager to support candidates who back science-based policies. While a few scientist-candidates are running as independents, most are Democrats making their first foray into party politics. (More than 80 percent of scientists in a 2014 Pew survey identified as Democrats or Democrat-leaning.) 314 Action is working with 30 congressional candidates across the country and expects to formally endorse about half that number.\u201d\n\n-- The National Journal\u2019s Josh Kraushaar argues that, if Republicans lose the special election in Pennsylvania, it will be \u201can unmistakable verdict that the healthy economy and Trump tax cuts will be overshadowed by the administration\u2019s dysfunction and roiling suburban anger.\u201d \u201cEven a close loss in such a reliably conservative area would raise red flags that Democrats are on the verge of a major landslide in the November midterms. \u2026 Though the economy may play to the GOP\u2019s advantage, the culture wars have turned squarely in the Democratic Party\u2019s favor \u2014 and that\u2019s what matters in today\u2019s politics. \u2026 Republicans are eager to pin a disappointing result in this election on their candidate \u2014 state Rep. Rick Saccone\u2014but the reality is the race is being defined on Trump\u2019s terms.\u201d\n\n-- A new poll finds Virginia Republicans have not consolidated support around a candidate to oppose Sen. Tim Kaine. Jenna Portnoy reports: \u201cCorey Stewart, the self-styled mini-Trump who nearly won the gubernatorial nomination last year, has a slight lead, but 66 percent of voters are undecided, the [Wason Center for Public Policy] poll found. The primary is June 12. The other candidates are evangelical pastor E.W. Jackson; Bert Mizusawa, a retired major general in the U.S. Army Reserve and foreign policy adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign; two-term state Del. Nicholas J. \u2018Nick\u2019 Freitas (R-Culpeper); and political newcomer Ivan Raiklin. Stewart enters as the most well-known candidate with the support of 16 percent of potential GOP primary voters.

The assaults could last hours, leaving scores of burned or maimed corpses behind. Multiple Rohingya escapees said they saw the bodies of women whose breasts had been sliced off. \u2026 The violence has also upended what was supposed to be an American success story \u2014 the much-f\u00eated opening to an increasingly democratic Myanmar, championed by a U.S. president, Barack Obama, eager to make friends of old enemies willing to change their behavior.

Most such flights unload their human cargo once they land, but this flight, for logistical reasons, returned home \u2014 and brought witnesses back with it. The Somalis told of abuse on the flight, saying they were shackled with chains on their wrists, waists, and legs for more than 40 hours; forced to urinate in bottles or on themselves; and that ICE officers beat and threatened some passengers.

Although most of the quakes in this week\u2019s swarm are 3-5 km (2-3 mi) from the Calaveras Fault, the swarm has been migrating toward the Calaveras over the past few days.\n\nThe Calaveras Fault and lost seismograms\n\nWith a slip rate of about 15 mm/yr (0.6 in/yr) and a length of about 100 km (60 mi), the Calaveras is highly active and certainly capable of a M7+ earthquake. The fault cuts through the towns of Walnut Creek, San Ramon, Dublin, Pleasanton, Sunol, and Hollister.\n\nThe largest historical quake on the Calaveras Fault was a M=6.6 event in 1911 (Doser, 2009), but far too little is known about this large event. At that time, most U.S. seismic observatories were run by scientist priests at Jesuit universities. But by the time these professors began to die in mid-century, their lifelong seismogram archives were\u2014inconceivably and unconscionably\u2014thrown out. Only one 1911 seismogram from the U.S. survived, from the University of St. Louis, which was saved by Prof. John Ebel, former director of the Weston Observatory of Boston College.\n\nSwarms mean creep\n\nSwarms likely light up portions of faults that suddenly begin to creep\u2014or slip at a much higher rate than usual. Some 600 quakes struck San Ramon, also near the Calaveras Fault, in October 2015 (Xue et al, 2018). Another swarm struck the central portion of the Calaveras Fault in April 2016 (http://temblor.net/earthquake-insights/calaveras-535/); neither triggered a larger shock. Most faults do not creep at all, but parts of the San Andreas, Hayward and Calaveras all do. Why faults start and stop creeping is a mystery, but most swarms and creep events do not cascade into larger earthquakes.\n\nNevertheless, should this swarm penetrate the Calaveras Fault, the chances of a larger shock will climb, and the monitoring vigilance will intensify. If you live or work in the East Bay, this is the time to ask yourself if you are quake ready. This means having an emergency kit and plan, securing your contents, retrofitting an older home, and considering insurance.\n\nSources\n\nUSGS\n\nCalifornia Geological Survey\n\nDoser, Diane I., Kim B.

This decision is difficult because major earthquakes are infrequent, and it is unclear when one may happen, how big it could be, and how much harm it may cause. Moreover, these nations have profound immediate needs, including such ongoing rapid transformations as urbanization.\n\nTough societal challenges for which crucial information is missing and proposed solutions involve complex interactions with other issues are called \u201cwicked\u201d problems [Rittel and Webber, 1973]. These contrast with \u201ctame\u201d problems in which necessary information is available and solutions, even if difficult and expensive, are straightforward to identify and execute.\n\nA close look at issues involved with mitigating earthquake risk in Bangladesh illustrates what researchers and disaster managers can do address wicked problems in disaster management. The examination shows that wicked problems, despite their complexity, can be approached with strategies that should reduce vulnerabilities and potentially save lives.\n\nWicked or Tame?\n\nUpdating the United States\u2019 aging infrastructure is a tame problem because what is wrong and how to fix it are clear. In contrast, addressing climate change is a wicked problem because its effects are uncertain and the best strategies to address them are unclear [Stang and Ujvari, 2015].\n\nNatural hazard problems can be tame or wicked. Earthquake hazard mitigation for San Francisco is a relatively tame problem. Studies of regional geology and past earthquakes have been used to infer shaking in future earthquakes and develop mitigation approaches, including codes for earthquake-resistant construction. The population is affluent and aware enough to accept these measures, although financing and carrying out these measures is still challenging.\n\nIn contrast, earthquake hazard mitigation in Bangladesh and its surroundings is a wicked problem (Figure 1). Bangladesh is the world\u2019s most densely populated nation, with 160 million people, approximately half the U.S. population, crowded into an area the size of Iowa. The region lies on the boundary between plates whose collision uplifts the Himalayas, but complex geology and sparse data make it difficult to assess earthquake hazard. Thus, it is difficult to decide how much of the limited resources available should be used for earthquake hazard mitigation, given other more immediate needs.\n\nFor example, 31% of Bangladeshis live below the national poverty line, according to data from 2010. Per capita gross domestic product is only about $1,200, so Bangladesh needs to devote resources to economic growth. Bangladesh also needs resources to address challenges resulting from the nation\u2019s low elevation. Almost half the population lives within 10 meters of sea level, so the country is very vulnerable to tropical cyclones, riverine flooding, and rising sea level.\n\nHazards, Risks, and Vulnerability\n\nRisks are affected by human actions that increase or decrease vulnerability, such as where people live and how they build. \u201cHazards\u201d are the natural occurrence of earthquakes or other phenomena over which we have no control, whereas \u201crisks\u201d are the dangers they pose to lives and property. In this formulation, risk is the product of hazard and vulnerability. We want to assess hazards\u2014to estimate their significance\u2014and develop methods to reduce vulnerabilities and mitigate the resulting losses.\n\nWe can assess hazards only as best we can, but risks are affected by human actions that increase or decrease vulnerability, such as where people live and how they build. A disaster occurs when, because of high vulnerability, a natural event has major negative consequences for society.\n\nVulnerable Urban Areas\n\nAssessments of hazards, vulnerabilities, and risks illustrate another factor that makes the earthquake problem particularly wicked for developing countries: Many are rapidly urbanizing and thus increasing their vulnerability such that earthquake hazards will have amplified effects. For example, in their humid subtropical environment, rural Bangladeshis traditionally relied on modest homes with walls of mud or bamboo, which are less dangerous and more easily rebuilt than large concrete structures.\n\nAlong the Himalayan plate boundary, more than 50 million people now live in cities of at least a million inhabitants, including the capitals of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. These rapidly growing, crowded megacities are filled with multistory concrete buildings that are likely vulnerable to earthquakes. Dhaka, Bangladesh\u2019s capital, is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing megacities. Some 16 million people currently live in Dhaka, and the potential collapse of services and accessibility after an earthquake compounds their risks.\n\nSmall Shifts, Big Effects\n\nUrban vulnerabilities are only expressed when hazards trigger them. And in Bangladesh, hazards have the potential to be great.\n\nThe Indian tectonic plate moves northward toward Eurasia at a pace of about 50 millimeters each year (Figure 1). This continuing collision has raised the great Himalayas and caused large destructive earthquakes along the plate boundary. Bangladesh is at the boundary\u2019s northeastern end, which is complicated and poorly understood.\n\nThe plate boundary forms a roughly east\u2013west arc along the Himalayas, bends 180\u00b0 around the eastern Himalayan syntaxis, and then transitions into a broad zone of roughly north\u2013south trending folds and thrusts, the Indo-Burma Ranges [Steckler et al., 2008]. The boundary continues southward to the Andaman-Sumatra subduction zone. Although the deformation zone that accommodates the motion between India and southeast Asia is often called the Burma platelet, multiple active structures indicate this \u201cplatelet\u201d is not rigid.\n\nUntil recently, it was unclear whether the India\u2013Indo-Burma motion included convergence [Gahalaut et al., 2013] and caused megathrust earthquakes. However, GPS data show that although the motion is highly oblique, it has a significant convergence component [Steckler et al., 2016]. This deformation, at 13\u201317 millimeters per year, appears to be loading the locked shallow megathrust, along which India subducts beneath Burma (Figures 1b and 1c). The strain from this deformation will likely be released in future large earthquakes, like those at other subduction zones [Steckler et al., 2016].\n\nWhat We Know and What We Don\u2019t\n\nThese new data provide only some of the information needed to estimate the danger of future earthquakes. Scientists also need better estimates of how often large earthquakes may happen on sufficiently close active faults, how big they may be, and how much shaking they may cause. Results are compiled in earthquake hazard maps predicting how much shaking is expected to occur with a certain probability within a certain period of time. These maps are used to prepare for earthquakes, notably via building codes that prescribe earthquake-resistant construction.\n\nAlthough we have no way of knowing the future, we can make estimates with information about past earthquakes. For example, the Juan de Fuca plate subducts beneath northern California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia much as India subducts beneath the Indo-Burma Ranges. This area, known as the Cascadia subduction zone, was widely considered to be mostly aseismic until geological records became available. These records showed that large earthquakes happened some 530 years apart over the past 10,000 years, although the intervals are irregular [Goldfinger et al., 2012]. The most recent, in 1700 CE, is thought to have had a moment magnitude (M w ) of about 9.\n\nWe can gain insight on what to expect if we assume that the future will resemble the past when we derive earthquake hazard maps, but Earth does not always cooperate, and surprises are inevitable [Stein et al., 2012]. Add to this a lack of information, which makes Bangladesh\u2019s situation much more challenging.\n\nHazard assessment for the Indo-Burma boundary is like the assessments for Cascadia before evidence of past megathrust earthquakes became available. Dhaka has been shaken by both teleseismic (distant) and local earthquakes during recent times [Akhter, 2010], but there is little documentation of past megathrust earthquakes. As a result, there is no good way to estimate how often such earthquakes may occur, how big they may be, or how much shaking they may cause.\n\nThe limited historical records we do have indicate that no megathrust earthquake has ruptured beneath Dhaka since 1610. If this is true, then the strain from more than 5 meters of motion has been stored on the megathrust. If this strain were released in one earthquake, it would have M w ~8.2. If it has been longer since the last earthquake, the next temblor may be even bigger. Such a large earthquake seems possible: The plate boundary segment to the south ruptured in 1762 in an earthquake estimated as M w 8.5\u20138.8 [Cummins, 2007; Wang et al., 2013].\n\nFurthermore, the subduction zone here is extremely large and complex. Field geology and seismic data [Sikder and Alam, 2003; Betka et al., 2016] indicate that the megathrust is unusually broad and shallow, but it is uncertain whether and how often it ruptures seismically. It\u2019s also unclear whether slip in an earthquake would taper to the west or whether the frontal zone would rupture in separate, less frequent earthquakes [Wang et al., 2014]. Might only some of the megathrust earthquakes propagate to the thrust tip near Dhaka? Splay faults rooting the folds and other faults within the plate boundary zone are also possible sources of damaging earthquakes [e.g., Debbarma et al., 2017]. The multiple scenarios increase the uncertainty in seismic hazard assessment.\n\nTackling the Problem\n\nAlthough protecting millions of urban dwellers in Bangladesh might seem daunting, it is not hopeless; Bangladesh has tackled this kind of problem before. Although protecting millions of urban dwellers in Bangladesh might seem daunting, it is not hopeless; Bangladesh has tackled this kind of problem before. Over a span of decades, Bangladesh has successfully reduced the risk from tropical cyclones. Shelters have been built along the coast, and a network of volunteers warns people when to evacuate. A cyclone in 1970, before the program, killed 300,000\u2013500,000 people. By 2007, 1.5 million people took refuge in shelters ahead of Cyclone Sidr, reducing the death toll to about 4,300. Efforts continue to increase the stock of cyclone shelters and promote recovery after storms.\n\nSimilar efforts are beginning for earthquakes. The Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief has adopted 12 July as Earthquake Day, to be observed with earthquake drills and seminars to increase awareness. Scientists are preparing hazard maps for the country, although the maps are preliminary and are bound to have large uncertainties.\n\nInitial studies and planning efforts are devoted to exploring the consequences of large earthquakes [World Bank and Earthquakes and Megacities Initiative, 2014]. Assessment of the building stock typical in developing nations shows their vulnerability to earthquakes. In Dhaka, ~21% of the buildings are easily damaged, unreinforced masonry (brick) construction. About 77% are reinforced concrete but have not been designed to resist earthquake shaking. Moreover, in many cases the site preparation and construction are thought to be poor. Although a building code was enacted in 2006, enforcement is limited, and newer buildings may be as vulnerable as older ones. For example, Dhaka\u2019s Rana Plaza opened in 2009 when the code was in place. In 2013, it collapsed, killing more than 1,100 people.\n\nA further problem is that Dhaka and most of Bangladesh are located on the sediments of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta. Earthquake shaking in thick sediments is generally enhanced relative to hard rock, but the amount depends on the size and shape of the basin and the sediment properties. Surface sediment is prone to liquefaction and sand boils, in which strong shaking causes saturated soil to lose strength or develop high pore pressure and sand eruptions. For example, the 2017 M w 5.7 earthquake in Tripura, India [Debbarma et al., 2017], caused sand boils and damaged buildings in northeast Bangladesh about 40 kilometers away.\n\nReasonable Risk Reduction Steps\n\nMitigation is like buying insurance; we spend money today to reduce consequences of possible future events. The case study of Bangladesh illustrates the challenge of how to address an uncertain hazard, given limited resources [Stein and Stein, 2014]. How much mitigation is enough? Mitigation is like buying insurance; we spend money today to reduce consequences of possible future events. More mitigation reduces future losses but costs more now; resources used for mitigation are not available for other purposes. Money spent making existing schools earthquake resistant cannot be used to build schools or hire teachers for communities that have none [Kenny, 2009].\n\nIdeally, if the hazard were well understood, economic models could be used to develop mitigation strategies. The total cost of natural disasters to society is the sum of the expected loss in future disasters and the cost of mitigation. This total depends on the amount of mitigation, shown schematically by the U-shaped curve in Figure 2.\n\nIf we undertake no mitigation, we have no mitigation costs (left side of the curve) but expect high losses, so it makes sense to invest more in mitigation. Increased mitigation should decrease losses, so the curve goes down. Eventually, however, the cost of more mitigation exceeds the reduced losses, and the curve rises again. These additional resources would be better invested otherwise. The optimum mitigation is the sweet spot at the bottom of the curve.\n\nUncertainties in our ability to assess hazards and resulting losses limit our ability to determine an optimal strategy. Moreover, given limited resources, a community is likely to spend less than the optimum anyway. Fortunately, spending less is better than doing nothing (Figure 2), and we can still suggest strategies that make sense given the high uncertainty and limited resources. This approach follows the idea that \u201cthe best is the enemy of the good\u201d: Requiring too much safety would cost so much that nothing is likely to be done.\n\nPublic education and understanding is needed to raise support for any level of investment. Recent nearby earthquakes, like the 2004 Sumatra, 2015 Gorkha, and 2016 Manipur earthquakes, which caused shaking and damage in Bangladesh, have raised earthquake awareness in the country. The scientific community is providing better understanding and monitoring of tectonics and earthquake processes in and around Bangladesh. These developments offer Bangladesh the opportunity to increase earthquake preparedness and reduce earthquake risk [Akhter, 2010].\n\nBuilding New Versus Fixing Old\n\nAs the population shifts from rural to urban, the extensive construction that follows provides an opportunity for earthquake risk reduction. This opportunity stems from one key idea: A crucial step to mitigating earthquake risk in Bangladesh is enforcing the building code.\n\nStudies show that a moderate degree of safety is achievable with a modest, perhaps 5%\u201310%, increase in building costs [Schulze et al., 1987]. Over time, natural turnover of buildings will make communities more resilient. Thus, an approach to reducing risk is to plan the desired fraction of safer buildings over time and to incentivize new safer construction over modifying unsafe existing buildings.\n\nBecause strengthening (retrofitting) an older building can cost between 25% and 70% of the building\u2019s value, we recommend this approach for only the most critical structures. Because strengthening (retrofitting) an older building can cost between 25% and 70% of the building\u2019s value, we recommend this approach for only the most critical structures [Arikan et al., 2005; McMonies, 2016]. For example, the Bangladeshi government has decided to retrofit some fire stations.\n\nOutside of critical infrastructure, the ideal case is when tenants would pay more for ensuring the safety of their buildings. However, conditions aren\u2019t always ideal.\n\nErdik and Durukal [2008] report on similar issues faced in Istanbul, a comparable setting. Assessments showed that retrofits would cost about 40% of replacement value. Their study showed that Istanbul residents viewed this \u201cas an investment with no financial return and, as such, no conceivable reduction in insurance premium, property tax, or building permit fees would be sufficient to create an incentive for retrofitting.\u201d This response was rational, unless one postulates a high probability of major damage on a short timescale [Kenny, 2009]. Hence, a major retrofitting program would require large investment of public funds, which is unrealistic given other needs.\n\nPutting It All Together\n\nRecommendations by World Bank and Earthquakes and Megacities Initiative [2014] favor raising public earthquake awareness; building competency for architects, engineers, planners, and construction professionals; improving emergency response; and planning land use in a risk-sensitive manner. Ongoing programs, such as the annual U.S.-Bangladesh Pacific Resilience Disaster Response Exercise and Exchange, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery program, and the Comprehensive Disaster Management Program, build toward these goals.\n\nRobust risk management is practical, even for developing nations. It involves recognizing uncertainties and developing policies that should give a reasonable outcome for a range of the possible hazard and loss scenarios. It requires accepting the need for humility in the face of the complexities and capriciousness of nature while making realistic policies that the public accepts. Although long-term investments in risk reduction compete with immediate needs, they will pay back handsomely should a major earthquake strike.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank the editors and reviewers for helping to improve this paper.

But a different and chaotic scene unfolded about 1:30 p.m. Thursday, when rescue workers raced to free victims from blocks of concrete and fractured metal.\n\nNow Playing:\n\nAn school news release on Saturday hailed the bridge's \"first-of-its kind\" construction that was supposed to reduce \"potential risks to workers, commuters and pedestrians and minimizes traffic interruptions.\"\n\nIt is not yet clear whether design or construction issues played a role in the bridge's failure. Ron Sachs, a spokesman for FIGG Engineering, which designed the bridge, said he could not provide any details as to whether the construction methods were a factor in the collapse. And the director of the Miami-Dade Police Department, Juan Perez, declined to say whether stress tests had been conducted on the bridge.\n\nAmong the five deadliest bridge collapses in United States, flawed planning and execution have led to tragedy. But so have freak accidents.\n\nSilver Bridge, between Point Pleasant, West Virginia, and Gallipolis, Ohio, 1967:\n\nPhoto: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive Workers continue to search the Ohio River scene of a bridge...\n\nLast December marked the 50th anniversary of the collapse of this bridge, built in 1928, which carried as many as 4,000 vehicles over the Ohio River between Ohio and West Virginia each day. The Engineering News Record in 1929 called it \"the first of its type in the United States\" because of its use of eyebars -55-foot-long sections of steel- instead of steel wire cables.\n\nWhile the original design of the two-lane bridge called for conventional wire cables, the eyebar chain design was chosen instead because it was cheaper, according to theWest Virginia Department of Transportation. The Engineering News Record at the time ominously noted that, based on the bridge's design, \"any adjustments in the chains, hangers, or trusses after erection\" would not be possible.\n\nOn Dec. 5, 1967, eyewitnesses heard a loud noise that sounded like a gunshot. In less than 20 seconds, the bridge \"folded like a deck of cards,\" according to theWest Virginia Department of Transportation. Sixty-four people - and 32 vehicles - fell into the river, and 46 people died.\n\nAn investigation into the bridge's collapse found it was spurred by a small stress crack inside the loop of an eyebar, brought on by corrosion, and practically impossible to detect without taking apart the entire eyebar. But taking apart the eyebar would have compromised the bridge's structural integrity.\n\nLaboratory work concluded that, \"With the north . . . chain thus broken, the structure's design made total collapse . . . inevitable.\"\n\nThe absence of the bridge connecting Ohio and West Virginia led to an economic loss of about $1 million a month, prompting President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 to order a federal-state program for its immediate reconstruction. The Silver Memorial Bridge connecting Gallipolis and Henderson, W. Va., was completed in 1969. It still stands today.\n\nSunshine Skyway Bridge, Tampa Bay, Florida, 1980:\n\nPhoto: Keystone, File 1980: Debris from the Sunshine Skyway Bridge perched on the...\n\nWhen the freighter Summit Venture rammed into the Sunshine Skyway Bridge across Tampa Bay, Florida, in 1980, the bridge's structures collapsed, and six cars, a truck and a Greyhound bus plunged 150 feet through steel and iron beams into Tampa Bay,according to NPR. Thirty-five people were killed.\n\nThe new Sunshine Skyway was completed in 1987 and still stands today. This new bridge incorporated safer features: It was higher, for example, and the channel underneath it widened. Large concrete barriers, called \"dolphins,\" were installed to keep ships from hitting the bridge.\n\nHyatt Regency Hotel skywalks, Kansas City, Missouri, 1981:\n\nPhoto: DAN WHITE, AP Workers work to free victims from beneath the wreckage of two...\n\nDecades later, there's almost no indication at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Kansas City, Missouri, that two suspended skywalks plummeted to the hotel's crowded lobby floor during a casual afternoon dance, as the opening bars of Duke Ellington's \"Satin Doll\" played. The collapse killed 111 people and injured 188 in what is still considered the city's bloodiest tragedy.\n\nThe collapse dropped tons of steel, concrete and glass onto dozens of dancing couples,The Washington Post reported at the time. Many of the couples were elderly, partaking in the one-year-old hotel's regular function. The walkway had allowed about 50 people to peer down at the dancing couples from high above.\n\nA government study conducted in February 1982 found that the 32-ton skywalks had barely supported their own weight, and that a change in the original design of the elevated walkways during their construction worsened the issue. Still, even the original design involved a \"load tolerance less than that required by city codes,\" according to The Post. The Post reported:\n\n\"The report said that a decision during construction to change the design 'further aggravated an already critical situation.' The original design had both walkways suspended from the hotel roof by a common set of rods. The design change had the fourth-floor walkway suspended by one set of rods and the second-floor walkway suspended from the walkway above it by another set.\n\nThe design change left the walkways capable of bearing only 21,400 pounds, rather than the 68,000 pounds required under the building code, according to the report.\"\n\nCypress Street Viaduct, Oakland, California, 1989:\n\nPhoto: Michael Macor, AP 1989: In this photo taken Oct. 17, 1989, a pick up truck sits on...\n\n\"Interstate 880, Down and Out in Oakland,\" read the October 1989 headline of aWashington Poststory after the freeway's Cypress Street Viaduct, described as a \"concrete-and-steel leviathan,\" collapsed in a 6.9 magnitude earthquake. Forty-two people were killed.\n\nBuilt in 1957, the concrete roadway's two-tier design was common in California, incorporating complex design calculations (during an era when highway engineers did not use computers) to gauge how much steel was necessary to support the structure. When the roadway collapsed, engineers and geologists determined that its collapse was inevitable.\n\nThe factors that led to the collapse, The Post reported, included the structure's \"hinge joints,\" used to add flexibility to the structure:\n\n\"1) 'Hinge joints' were included in the freeway's column design to absorb weight and vertical movement caused by traffic. But during the Loma Prieta quake the ground also shook laterally, creating stress the hinge joints could not withstand.\n\n\"2) Few steel reinforcing rods snaked up through the joints. The upper and lower columns are honeycombed with these \"rebars,\" but the hinge joints contain only a few.\n\n\"3) During the quake, the columns acted like weak legs on a wobbly table. The lateral movement caused them to snap outward at the weakest point - the hinge joints - freeing the upper deck to pancake down onto the lower one.\"\n\nBig Bayou Canot Bridge, Mobile, Alabama, 1993:\n\nPhoto: Mark Foley/AP FILE - This Sept. 22, 1993 file photo shows the wreckage of the...\n\nWhen Amtrak's Sunset Limited train crossed the Big Bayou Canot Bridge in Mobile, Alabama, in September 1993, the train derailed, sending three locomotives and four front cars plunging into the creek.

For dozens of others, the only way to safety was jumping into the bayou, where water rose well above their heads. Twenty-seven of the 30 people in one passenger car died when it roared off the bridge and sank completely.\"\n\nForty-seven people died in the disaster.\n\nWhat the train's passengers didn't know was that minutes before the derailment, the towboat MV Mauvilla was lugging six barges loaded with coal and cement up the river to Birmingham.

And this background noise is what covers up small earthquakes. The ConvNetQuake algorithm builds on recent advances in deep learning and was trained on a large dataset of labeled raw seismic waveforms that helped it to learn a compact representation that can discriminate seismic noise from earthquake signals.

Researchers have been working on a number of new technologies, including satellites, underwater seismic sensors and software to detect earthquakes and even predict them. One new tool unveiled in the journal Science Advances last week looks to be very promising.Drawing on speech recognition technology, researchers developed a convoluted neural network called ConvNetQuake that detects even the tiniest tremor against geological background noise, much in the same way the human ear can detect someone speaking in a moving car by tuning out vehicle background noise.The study was led by Thibaut Perol, a senior deep learning scientist at Gram Labs, an AI startup based in Washington, DC.

When I see news about my former state, it\u2019s like reading the details of a train wreck after having safely disembarked a comfortable time ago.\n\nI and my family got to live in Orange County for seven glorious years and another year in the Bay Area when the state was not convulsed with insanity on stilts.\n\nIt was sunny nearly every day, with low humidity. There were no bugs. Our local amusement parks were Disneyland and Knott\u2019s Berry Farm. We did, as Californians are fond of boasting, go to the beach and then later that day drive up into snow-covered mountains just to say we did. You can still do this.\n\nThe Sunday edition of the Los Angeles Times, for which I worked as a news editor at the time, was so big and fat with ads that Times staffers swore that a deliveryman in Beverly Hills once hit a chihuahua with a paper, killing it. Whether it really happened or not, it was at least plausible.\n\nWhich brings us to something entirely implausible \u2014 the state-of-the-art bullet train, now under construction. Somehow, we got along fine without a bullet train from Los Angeles to San Francisco. A maniacal pipe dream of Gov. Jerry Brown, its price tag was increased last week to $77.3 billion. The train\u2019s projected opening date has been pushed back another four years, to 2033.\n\nWhen this thing is done, they claim, you will be able to zip between Southern California and Baghdad by the Bay in only three hours. Minus any time spent restoring track after a particularly bad earthquake.\n\nOf course, you can get to Frisco faster if you hop on one of the many daily flights from LAX to San Francisco International Airport or vice versa. And by the time the railroad opens up, we might even be able to beam there, courtesy of Cal Tech and other brainy places. Meanwhile, California is in the midst of yet another fiscal crisis. It\u2019s fast becoming the mother of all welfare magnet states while welcoming a surge in illegal immigration. In January, Gov. Brown announced a $1.6 billion deficit by next summer. The total estimated public debt of the Golden State is $1.3 trillion.\n\nWhat a curious time to throw billions at a train to the future. Can you imagine how many fares it would take to recoup even a microscopic fraction of the expense? Even if passengers jump aboard and pack the roof like on the trains in Calcutta.\n\nThe cost alone is so staggering that it defies perspective. But here\u2019s some. The Big Dig, the fabulously costly patronage highway project in Boston that began construction in 1991 and opened in 1998, cost $22 billion, including interest. That\u2019s nearly 10 times the initial projected cost of $2.8 billion.\n\nIn 2006, a main artery of the system was named for Thomas P. \u201cTip\u201d O\u2019Neill, Jr., the former Democratic U.S. speaker of the House, who used his enormous influence to secure federal tax dollars.\n\nThe \u201cChunnel,\u201d the English Channel tunnel that has connected Great Britain and France since 1994, cost only $21 billion. The Large Hadron \u201cSuper\u201d Collider, which opened near Geneva, Switzerland, in 2009 and measures particles traveling at nearly the speed of light, cost a mere $6 billion. Even the Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, cost only $4.5 billion to $6 billion.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s fiscal folly would be laughable if everything that started in California did not wind up on our doorsteps from Alaska to Georgia. In what may be a harbinger for advancing illegal immigration, just this past week, state Senate President pro tem Kevin de Leon, Los Angeles Democrat, named the first illegal alien to occupy a state office, a student grant advisory committee.\n\nCalifornia has 40 million people, more than a tenth of the U.S. population, and 53 members of Congress. Its economy is the sixth largest, at $2.4 trillion GDP (in 2015), behind the United States, China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom and just above France and Brazil, according to International Monetary Fund figures crunched by the Brown administration.\n\nIts politicians stride across the national stage as larger-than-life figures. Think of Ronald Reagan and Nancy Pelosi. Reagan is best known for winning the Cold War and restoring America\u2019s confidence and prosperity. But that was yesterday. Today, well, Mrs. Pelosi, the current House Minority Leader, was boasting last week about being a judge on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race All-Stars show. That\u2019s where men who dress like women compete in various events.\n\n\u201cThis idea of people believing in themselves, being themselves, taking pride in themselves, is not just a lesson for politicians but for everyone in the country,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nCalifornia \u2014 a train wreck in progress.

In 1980, running against Jimmy Carter, he\u2019d won the state by only 39,000 votes, but it was now morning in America again, and the president was in an appropriately sunny mood as his rally began, shortly after noon, in downtown Charlotte.\n\nAs is customary in politics, Reagan praised his audience, then himself. Soon, he turned to attacking the Democrats, whom he accused of keeping people \u201cin bondage as wards of the state.\u201d They wanted dependents, not citizens. And instead of listening to Americans, liberals would tell Americans what to do.\n\nTo illustrate his point, Reagan alluded to a matter of fierce contention across the South: the court-ordered integration of public schools and the yellow buses that frequently made that integration happen, carrying white children to predominantly black schools and black children to white ones.\n\nBut there was no cheering, no applause, only the stony silence that accompanies an errant note. And when a reaction did come, it was in the form of a Charlotte Observer editorial titled, flatly, \u201cYou Were Wrong, Mr. President.\u201d The paper\u2019s editors chided Reagan, writing that Charlotte\u2019s \u201cproudest achievement of the past 20 years is not the city's impressive new skyline or its strong, growing economy. Its proudest achievement is its fully integrated schools.\u201d\n\nBack then, the claim was true. Charlotte-Mecklenburg (the district includes Charlotte\u2019s surrounding suburbs in Mecklenburg County) had achieved true racial parity in its schools, and had done so without the violence or rancor that accompanied similar efforts, not only in the Deep South but in Northern cities like Boston and Chicago. In Memphis, Tennessee, opponents of integration buried a school bus. In Charlotte, the buses came and went. Long known as the Queen City, Charlotte had an enviable new nickname: \u201cThe city that made desegregation work.\u201d\n\nThe nickname would not apply today. Charlotte, in 2018, looks like most other American cities, where schools are nearly as segregated as they were before the 1954 Supreme Court decision of Brown v. Board of Education, which declared separate but equal schools to be unconstitutional. Some cities, like New York, never really integrated their schools, hiding for decades under the guise of Northern liberalism. Many others complied with court orders, but did so unwillingly and incompletely, without ever convincing people that integration was a public good. Charlotte was the rare city that made its citizens believe in integration, and those citizens in turn made integration work. Their retreat from that experiment has been revealing\u2014and complete.\n\nEarlier this year, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, or CMS, published a report titled \u201cBreaking the Link,\u201d which explored the relationship between poverty and education. A single sentence in the introduction grimly sums up the state of things: \u201cIf you are born poor in Charlotte, you are likely to stay that way.\u201d In a low-poverty school (i.e., a school where less than a quarter of students are eligible for a free lunch and breakfast program), 95.2 percent of students graduate; only 77.6 percent graduate in a high-poverty school, where more than half of students are eligible for free lunch. The latter have younger, less experienced teachers. There are more disciplinary problems at these schools, and test scores are lower.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nThe links between poverty and education also pertain to race. \u201cFor all grade spans, low-poverty schools were composed of mostly white students,\u201d the report\u2019s authors wrote, \u201cwhereas in high-poverty schools, the majority of students were black and Hispanic.\u201d This was the toxic nexus that Charlotte had once tried to dispel. And it did so with success, so that its schools made it onto the front page of The Wall Street Journal in 1991. Only a decade after that, the experiment ended, and now the gains of that time have been squandered.\n\nJames Ferguson is a civil rights lawyer who worked on the legal effort to desegregate Charlotte\u2019s schools. That was 50 years ago. He does not want to believe the work was futile, but a life of fighting discrimination cautions against shows of optimism. History is littered with disappointments, including his own. He was in junior high, at a segregated school in Asheville, North Carolina, when the Supreme Court delivered the Brown ruling. Like many, he thought things would change at once. But they didn\u2019t change at all because people in Birmingham, Alabama weren\u2019t going to take orders from Washington.\n\nThe nation delivered on the promise of Brown only because men and women like Ferguson forced it to, and to have the nation renege on that promise has been crushing. Ferguson is a civil leader in Charlotte, a power broker, and the sadness haunts him; he thought he\u2019d won a battle, when it turns out he lost. \u201cThere is no core of people who are actively pushing for school desegregation,\u201d he laments. \u201cWe\u2019re almost back to where we started from.\u201d\n\nSign up for our Newsletter Sign up\n\nUpdate your preferences \u00bb\n\nWe, in this case, could mean the entire United States. We came closest to integration in 1988, when nearly half of all African-American children attended majority white schools. Since then, districts have been casting off federal court orders like rusted shackles. The result, a Government Accountability Office report found in the spring of 2016, the number of African-American and Hispanic students attending segregated schools is rapidly growing.\n\nCharlotte was never supposed to be among those districts, though. That was the promise of Charlotte. For many decades, it was a promise realized.\n\nFrightened, White and Middle-Class\n\nThe bus may well be the most potent symbol of African-Americans\u2019 struggle for racial equality in the 20th century. In Montgomery, Alabama, a squat yellow-and-lime bus, numbered 2857, became the epicenter of the civil rights movement on December 1, 1955, when seamstress Rosa Parks refused to move toward the back, where blacks were forced to sit. About a decade later, as the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson took up the work of actually enforcing the Brown decision, it was the yellow school bus that became a vehicle of both social progress and deep-seated fears that made that progress so difficult.\n\nMatthew Delmont, the author of Why Busing Failed, has concluded that the first protest by white parents against the use of busing to redress racial imbalances in public schools took place in New York City in 1957. New York was exempt from Brown because its schools were not segregated by law, like those in the Deep South. That made white residents all the more furious, because they felt they had done nothing to segregate schools and should therefore not be forced to integrate them.\n\nJournalists were aware of these fears, and some played to them. A Wall Street Journal article warned that the city\u2019s Board of Education \u201cproposes extensive use of city-financed buses to create racially balanced schools.\u201d Delmont believes this was the first time a national outlet deployed the specter of \u201cbusing\u201d to frighten middle-class whites. (Buses had been transporting children for decades, and plenty of districts were already using racial criteria in zoning decisions to keep schools segregated.)\n\nBettmann Archive/Getty\n\nThe fearmongering worked, and it encouraged newspapers and television stations to report with greater avidity on what came to be known as \u201cforced busing.\u201d Opponents of busing predictably directed their anger at education bureaucrats, whom they accused of social engineering. As one letter to New York\u2019s central schools administration put it, \u201cThe Negro is emerging from ignorance, savagery, disease and total lack of any culture. Is it necessary to foist the Negro on the White Americans for fair play?\u201d\n\nDespite a halting effort at integration that began in 1957, little changed in Charlotte during the 1960s. Busing came to the city only after a 1969 federal district court ruling in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg County Board of Education, a suit brought by an African-American preacher who didn\u2019t understand why his son had to attend effectively segregated schools. The judge in the case was a white Southerner without especially strong liberal convictions. But he also understood that there was no legal standing for those who resisted integration. \u201cWhen racial segregation was required by law, nobody evoked the neighborhood school theory to permit black children to attend white schools closer to where they lived,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere is no reason except emotion\u2026why school buses can not be used\u2026to desegregate the schools.\u201d\n\nAnd so busing began in Charlotte on September 9, 1970, with 525 buses serving as the army of integration. White parents protested, and Charlotte, which claimed to be a city of the \u201cNew South,\u201d anxiously waited to discover whether its claim was anything more than a clever marketing pitch.\n\nGoodbye, White Flight\n\nIntegration turned out to look a lot like war. Mobs welcomed buses carrying black children into white neighborhoods. Whites threw rocks and hurled racial taunts. White children stayed away from schools. On the television sets that now graced nearly every home in the nation, Americans watched and wondered if racial reconciliation would ever be possible.\n\nThe year was 1974, and the city was Boston, not Charlotte. There, a court order mandated that Irish-Americans in South Boston enter into a busing arrangement with black Roxbury. Feeling that they were being bullied into integration by judges and politicians, aggrieved residents of Southie reacted with shows of violence and rage more associated with the Deep South than this city of patricians and academics.\n\nMeanwhile, 840 miles to the south, things were going just fine in Charlotte, now in its fourth year of integrated schooling. Watching the reports from Boston with confusion and dismay, students at West Charlotte High School, which had quickly become the centerpiece of Charlotte\u2019s success, decided to do something novel: They invited students from Boston to come down South, to see that integration could be done peacefully, to the benefit of all students. Five high schools students traveled to Charlotte that November. \u201cI think every KKK member in the South wrote me a personal letter calling me a nigger-lover and threatening me,\u201d recalled West Charlotte Principal Sam Haywood to historian Pamela Grundy many years later. He added, \u201cYou know, if adults had got out of the way, kids could solve most of the problems.\u201d\n\nBut adults had helped solve the problem in Charlotte. Specifically, well-off white adults who seemingly had the least to gain from integration. Some of the city\u2019s leading families decided they would send their children to West Charlotte High School, a sign that they were invested in the integration experiment. Maybe there was something selfish in this, too\u2014a desire to separate Charlotte from symbols of racial strife like Birmingham and Montgomery. Even so, they put their own children on school buses instead of merely watching as middle- and working-class whites did.\n\nAP Photo\n\nEveryone was uneasy about the experiment. As one African-American student recalled years later, \u201c[People] thought it was going to be racial tension every day. \u2018Here we go again. Six o\u2019clock news. A riot at West Charlotte again.\u2019 Never happened.\u201d Whites and blacks made the requisite effort. It wasn\u2019t a seamless union, but the rivets held.\n\nEventually, integration became a normal part of life in Charlotte, which made the city exceptional in the eyes of the nation. During his eight years in the White House, Reagan had appointed 364 judges to the federal bench, many of whom could be expected to execute his conservative, anti-government agenda, which included opposition to busing; his successor, George H.W. Bush, ran a racially divisive campaign predicated on raw fears about black criminality. In March 1991, the video of white police officers beating a black resident of Los Angeles named Rodney King confirmed a new mood of racial hostility\u2014or, even worse, that racial hostility had never gone away.\n\nTwo months after Americans learned of King\u2019s plight, The Wall Street Journal reported on the goings-on at West Charlotte. In a front-page article, the paper praised the school as a \u201cwarm picture of integrated young America,\u201d a hazy but hopeful vision of the type of society we have been trying to realize for half a century. \u201cParticularly in a city with a history of racial confrontation,\u201d the article said, \u201cit does seem extraordinary. In many urban centers, white flight has left school districts overwhelmingly black\u2026. Not Charlotte. Its school board has steadfastly rejected any proposals to end its forced busing program.\u201d\n\nBut by the time that article was published, some were already trying to undo the experiment.\n\n\u2018Race Is Not The Issue\u2019\n\nIn the early morning of January 17, 1994, a massive earthquake shook Los Angeles. After that, Bill Capacchione remembers, his wife said it was time to leave. She was a native of Southern California, and the quake had rattled her. \u201cIf this is not the big one, I don\u2019t want to be around for it,\u201d Capacchione recalls her saying. He offered Phoenix as a relatively close alternative. Too hot, she countered. Capacchione had gone to college in North Carolina, at Campbell University, so he suggested a city 130 miles due west of that school: Charlotte.\n\nAround that time, a lot of people were thinking of moving to Charlotte; it had recently become the third-biggest banking center in the nation, after New York and San Francisco. The same year that Capacchione arrived, The New York Times wrote of Charlotte\u2019s \u201crelentlessly upbeat, look-at-me corporate culture.\u201d The city\u2019s \u201cdowntown, which goes by the appropriately cheery appellation of Uptown, is a vital business center, and its green geography and relaxed, friendly style make it an inviting place,\u201d the article said.\n\nThe new arrivals may have worked in downtown, but they didn\u2019t live there. For the most part, they moved to suburbs to the north and south of the city, where subdivisions seemed to rise overnight. One recent study of land use in the county found that while only 12.5 percent of land in Mecklenburg County had been developed in 1976, 40 years later, that number had nearly quintupled, to 57.6 percent. Even as Charlotte thrived, it was Mecklenburg that grew.\n\nThe newcomers, like the Capacchiones, came from the West and Northeast, where schools were severely segregated, but few blamed racism; the segregation of a city like New York seemed to many like nothing more than a historical accident. There was, in fact, nothing even remotely accidental about the forces that turned Brownsville, Brooklyn, or the South Side of Chicago, into ghettos. But because police there hadn\u2019t disbanded protesters with water cannons, that segregation was easier to ignore.\n\nCharlotte had confronted its segregationist past, and that confrontation resulted in a remarkably successful school system. But to those who hadn\u2019t lived through the early, uncertain years of integration in the 1970s, the busing plan was confounding and not especially welcome. In the suburbs, especially, resistance grew. As early as 1988, a parent complained that Charlotte was \u201ca model for shifting children from one end of the county to the other and not a model for educational excellence by any means.\u201d\n\nSchool officials in Charlotte had sensed a growing resentment toward their integration plan. To fight off the criticisms of whites in the suburbs, they created a number of magnet schools throughout the 1990s, which would draw students from all over the county. (Magnet schools are an attractive solution, promising both academic excellence and integration. But the solution doesn\u2019t scale especially well.)\n\nOne of the popular new magnet programs in Charlotte was Olde Providence Elementary School, to the southeast of the city\u2019s center, which had undergone an expansion in 1992. This was where Capacchione tried to enroll his 6-year-old daughter, Cristina. She was denied admission. Capacchione tried again. But she still didn\u2019t get a spot. On September 5, 1997, Capacchione filed a suit against Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, alleging that his white daughter was discriminated against on the basis of her race and, as he explained from the stand, \u201cfelt she wasn't smart enough to get into Olde Providence.\u201d\n\nLee Lockwood/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty\n\nFive other families joined the suit. They argued that Charlotte had spent 30 years integrating its schools. The work had been so well done, they claimed, it didn\u2019t need to continue any longer. Larry Gauvreau, another recent transplant to Charlotte who joined the suit, judged the school system \u201cfully desegregated\u201d and any suggestion to the contrary \u201cabsurd.\u201d\n\nOn September 9, 1999\u201429 years to the day since busing began\u2014federal Judge Robert Potter issued his ruling in the Capacchione case. As a private citizen, Potter had opposed the initial 1970 desegregation plan. And he was an ally of Jesse Helms, the state\u2019s segregationist U.S. senator. Appointed to the federal bench by Reagan, Potter earned the nickname \u201cMaximum Bob\u201d for his tough sentences. He agreed with Capacchione, writing that, \u201cthe Court is convinced that CMS, to the extent reasonably practicable, has complied with the thirty-year-old desegregation order in good faith; that racial imbalances existing in schools today are no longer vestiges of the dual system; and that it is unlikely that the school board will return to an intentionally-segregative system.\u201d\n\nWith that, Charlotte\u2019s experiment with integration had ended, and the city was ordered to wind down its busing program. \u201cThe decision,\u201d observed The New York Times, \u201cwhich affects about 28,000 students who now ride buses past their neighborhood schools in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District, has enormous symbolic significance for the lingering institution of court-ordered busing.\u201d\n\nKids were now much more likely to go to their neighborhood schools. And since the neighborhoods themselves remained segregated, that means they were much more likely to go school with kids who looked like them. This was to some a problem and to others, who cheered the Potter decision, the whole point.\n\nCapacchione was not in Charlotte to celebrate the Potter decision. His wife missed her family, and the Capacchiones had moved back to Southern California. They live there still, down the coast from Los Angeles, in a city called Torrance. Capacchione says his daughter, Cristina, \u201cwent to neighborhood schools,\u201d to which she was always able to walk. \u201cTo me, race is not the issue,\u201d Capacchione says dispassionately, decisively. \u201cI didn\u2019t think any child should have his or her opportunities limited by race or by where they live.\"\n\nOn the first point, few Americans would disagree, at least in principle. The second assertion is more complex. The entire point of busing was to avoid relegating poor black children to inner-city schools. That couldn\u2019t happen unless parents like Capacchione were willing to give up their own access to superior suburban schools. But they had come to expect their own schools\u2014\u201cneighborhood schools,\u201d a phrase rich with Rockwellian intimations\u2014as a kind of constitutional right. There is no such right, however, any more than there is an inherent right to traffic lights instead of stop signs.\n\nCapacchione seemed confused about why anyone would want to talk about the court\u2019s decision. To him, it was old news. \u201cI probably would do it again,\" he says of his lawsuit. This isn\u2019t bravado. You can hear it in his voice: He has no regrets.\n\nThe Cost of Segregation\n\nKeith Lamont Scott sat in his truck, waiting for his son to arrive on a school bus. The truck was parked in a lot at an apartment complex northeast of downtown Charlotte, in an area that\u2019s largely poor and the schools are mostly black and Latino. It was September 20, 2016, just a little before 4 p.m. Within moments, Scott would be dead.\n\nMembers of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department were in the complex looking for someone else. They said they saw Scott in his vehicle, with a gun. His family insists he was reading. His wife, Rakeyia Scott, took video of what followed. You can see her approaching the several officers who have drawn their guns and surrounded her husband. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot him,\u201d she says.\n\nBut they do. No book was ever found. A gun was. The officer who shot and killed him\u2014Brentley Vinson, a young, black man\u2014was cleared of all charges. Black Lives Matter and other activist groups launched protests that consumed the city for days, as officers in riot gear took to Charlotte\u2019s streets like an invading army. The gleaming jewel of the New South suddenly seemed like its sullied Old South counterparts.\n\nThe part of Charlotte where Scott was killed makes up what is locally known as a \u201ccrescent\u201d of poverty that circles downtown. Several blocks from where Scott was shot is Newell Elementary School, which is 90 percent black or Hispanic; 99.6 of its students are on free or reduced lunch, meaning they live in poverty. Down the road is the Zebulon B. Vance High School, which is 90.7 percent black or Hispanic; 99.8 percent of its population qualifies for free or reduced lunch. The gap in the crescent is to the southeast of Charlotte, where \u201cthe wedge\u201d \u2014 a cluster of affluent suburbs \u2014 grows wider the further into Mecklenburg County it pushes, away from the inner city, into the verdant suburbs where poverty and violence are only the stuff of news reports Scott was killed by two bullets; he was condemned by history and demography, impersonal forces that converged on him on a Friday afternoon.\n\nThose same forces also did their work on Anthony Foxx, only they did so to far more auspicious effect than in Scott\u2019s case. Foxx is 46 today, which means he\u2019s a few years older than Scott when he was killed. He grew up in Charlotte, attending integrated schools there, including West Charlotte High. He went on to Davidson College, one of the best liberal arts schools in the South, and then to New York University for law school. In 2009, he was elected mayor of Charlotte, the youngest person to ever hold that office, and only the second African-American to do so. Four years later, President Barack Obama selected him to serve as head of the federal Transportation Department.\n\n\u201cI think many of the white kids who went to West Charlotte got as much of a taste of the black experience as any white person was likely to get at that time,\u201d he says. \u201cBlack kids like me, we saw whites as our counterparts. It was as equal a position as I\u2019ve been in at any time of my life, even since.\u201d\n\nFoxx warns against mythologizing Charlotte\u2019s integrated past. He remembers, for instance, that there were few African-American students in advanced classes. Still, the impact of the integrated experience has stayed with him. \u201cI think that whites and blacks and others whom I went to school with in those years are certainly more well rounded and understand American culture in a more true light than most of us do,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause they saw, even for a brief period of time, the tapestry that the country has.\u201d\n\nBy the time Foxx became mayor, the Capacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools decision had largely resegregated schools in Charlotte. \u201cNeighborhoods became more segregated following the declaration of unitary status,\u201d says Amy Hawn Nelson, a University of Pennsylvania education researcher who has closely studied Charlotte\u2019s demographics (a school district has reached \u201cunitary status\u201d when it is no longer deemed segregated). The result, Nelson says, was that real estate brokers could lure buyers by promising that their children would be guaranteed a spot in some well-regarded suburban school, since the fear of those children being bussed elsewhere was pretty much gone. And what typically burnishes a school\u2019s reputation? Racial composition, not academic achievement. \u201cEven when you look at school quality metrics, Nelson told me, \u201cwhite families are more likely to pick a white school rather than a high performing school.\u201d\n\nKENT D. JOHNSON/The Charlotte Observer\n\nThere have been efforts by school Charlotte-Mecklenburg superintendents\u2014who are independent of the mayor\u2014to skirt the ruling by creating more magnet schools and implementing \u201cstudent reassignment\u201d plans that modestly push for reintegration. Only the countervailing push is stronger. The internet allows for subatomic analysis of each school\u2019s demographics and academics. If they can get a child into Providence, one of the best high schools in Charlotte, they will. Who wouldn\u2019t? And thanks to Capacchione, they can do so without resorting to a federal lawsuit.\n\nMost of these people are liberals: Mecklenburg County voted for Obama twice, while Hillary Clinton nearly doubled Donald Trump\u2019s vote total in 2016. Yet it is one thing to vote in a school gymnasium for a politician you have never seen, quite another to watch your own child ascend the steps of a yellow bus. It used to be that voting and public education were seen as part of the same set of behaviors collectively called civic participation. No longer so, not when a scholarship to Stanford hangs in the balance. As the education writer Nikole Hannah-Jones has put it: \u201cWe began moving away from the \u2018public\u2019 in public education a long time ago. In fact, treating public schools like a business these days is largely a matter of fact in many places.\u201d Once citizens, we are now customers.\n\nFoxx has watched the city\u2019s resegregation with dismay. What he experienced at West Charlotte should have been the start of something hopeful; instead, it was an ending. \u201cIt\u2019s been interesting to watch my friends at that time more or less revert back to the areas of town they grew up in,\u201d he says.\n\nInteresting, yes, and in the case of Scott, tragic. School resegregation did not kill him, of course, but it contributed to the creation of a dual society. After the Scott killing, the sociologist Clint Smith wrote in The New Yorker that we \u201ccannot disentangle the state-sanctioned school resegregation that poor black students in Charlotte experience from the police killing of a black man waiting for his son to get off the bus from elementary school.\u201d\n\nWe have known as much for a long time. After the civil unrest of the summer of 1967, President Johnson set up a National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, better known as the Kerner Commission. Written as the smoke was still clearing from riots in Newark and Detroit, the Kerner report found many reasons for the unrest, public schools among them. \u201cThe hostility of Negro parents and students toward the school system is generating increasing conflict and causing disruption within many city school districts,\u201d warned the report. It can just as readily serve as context for the rage of Black Lives Matter activists who protested in Charlotte as Scott was being laid to rest.\n\nOur thinking is much more data-driven today, yet as far as school integration is concerned, the conclusions of scholars are not at all different from those of the Kerner Commission. Rucker Johnson, a labor economist at the University of California, Berkeley, has studied the effects of resegregation. In a forthcoming paper, he compared the life outcomes of students who\u2019d gone to integrated schools and those who went to schools were courts had lifted integrated orders. Johnson found that resegregation \u201ccaused significant increases in the likelihood of being arrested, of being convicted of a crime, and being incarcerated in adulthood for African-Americans.\u201d They were also likely to earn less.\n\nAs for whites, who experienced no deleterious effects from integration, Johnson found that resegregation would lead them to \u201chave no racial diversity among their friends in adulthood, to live in neighborhoods in adulthood without racial diversity, to express significantly stronger preferences for same-race partners, and were significantly less likely to have ever been in an interracial relationship.\u201d\n\nJohnson calls resegregation a \u201cmarket failure\u201d because it leads to outcomes that are not only unfavorable but also expensive. It is, after all, much cheaper to educate a child than to incarcerate an adult.\n\n\u2018The Miseducation of Our Kids\u2019\n\nToday, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools are led by Clayton Wilcox, who came to North Carolina from suburban Maryland. Wilcox admits that the kind of muscular integration once conducted in Charlotte is no longer possible. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any appetite except for a very few folks,\u201d Wilcox tells me after I asked about the possibility of bringing busing back. \u201cThe methods of yesterday,\u201d he says, no longer apply. \u201cYou have to create great schools everywhere,\u201d in reference to providing adequate funding to inner-city schools. Research by Johnson of Berkeley confirms that increased spending can ameliorate some, if not all, the effects of resegregation. Then again, spending is as anathema as busing to some.\n\nWilcox was not yet in Charlotte during the Scott shooting or the protests that followed. He references the killing as evidence of something amiss in the city, as well as its schools. \u201cWe are all in this together,\u201d he says. \u201cMany of the things we fear are the result of the miseducation of our kids.\u201d\n\nBut some don\u2019t share that sense of togetherness. Last year, Charlotte-Mecklenburg passed a $922 million bond measure that angered people in the northern reaches of Mecklenburg County, an area that is rapidly growing. No schools will be built there. A local county official named Jim Puckett who opposed the bond measure, believes the shortage of schools in the county\u2019s north (where not everyone is white) was intended to force residents of the suburbs to send their children to schools closer to central Charlotte, integrating them without quite having to say so.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got this angst in the suburbs,\u201d says Puckett. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting the capital resources.\u201d Some of the northern suburbs have even threatened to secede from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, thus creating their own school districts. School secession has become a popular way to avoid integration, especially in states controlled by Republican legislatures that have made it easier for municipalities to cleave from larger school districts. A report published last year by the nonprofit EdBuild found that 71 districts around the nation have tried secession since 2000. More than half have been successful; invariably, these splinter districts are whiter and wealthier than the district they are leaving.\n\n\"Parents tend to be rather self-serving,\u201d says Puckett, the Mecklenburg County official. \u201cThey come to the table with certain beliefs.\" And the prevailing belief in Charlotte, he says, is that the public schools are not working. Whites flee for the suburbs; African-American parents, meanwhile, are choosing charter schools, which have become symbols of voluntary resegregation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the city of Charlotte would ever abandon at-risk kids,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s just not gonna happen.\u201d\n\nIt is more likely that kids will abandon Charlotte\u2019s schools.\n\n\u2018We Sold Our Soul\u2019\n\nThere is a famous photograph that shows Dorothy Counts on the first day of school. It was taken on September 4, 1957, as she walked to Harding High School to start the ninth grade. Counts wears a plaid dress with a long white bow; to her left is her father, in a white shirt and slacks, looking grimly ahead. The two are surrounded by jeering whites. In one of the famous photographs from that morning, white hands make devil horns from behind Counts. She looks off into the distance, mouth askew. She is willfully ignorant of the bigots enveloping her like a thick cloud of mosquitoes.\n\nCounts only wanted to be a student. But because of her race, she was, above all, an agent of integration. She did not last long in Charlotte\u2019s integrated schools. The abuse of local whites had its intended effect, and after several weeks she was shipped off to live with family in Philadelphia. She completed her schooling there. It would be more than a decade until Charlotte seriously started integrating its schools.\n\nToday, Counts (now Dot Counts-Scoggins) lives in Charlotte again. She worked for years in early childhood education but is now retired. Once maligned, she is now celebrated. The library at Harding has been named after her. Charlotte magazine deemed her one of the city\u2019s essential citizens. \u201cIn some ways, we need her now as much as ever,\u201d the magazine said in November, lest Charlotte forget in this age of renewed animosities what it did to her all those years ago.\n\nCounts-Scoggins has not forgotten. \u201cWell, it\u2019s very disappointing to me when I look at what has happened in Charlotte,\u201d she says of the un-integration of the city\u2019s schools. \u201cI tell people, \u2018This didn\u2019t happen in Charlotte overnight. This was something that was happening, and people just sort of ignored it.\u201d\n\nIntegration is difficult work, the work of generations. It may not be especially gratifying to those who must undertake it. Segregation, on the other hand, feels natural enough. Difficult to expel, it is always eager to return. Integration may show its benefits in 50 years, but who wants to wait that long? We are an impatient species, increasingly skeptical of things unseen.\n\nAnd yet segregation takes a toll. Justin Perry was at West Charlotte High when he heard about Judge Potter\u2019s decision in 1999. He remembers leaving school and going downtown, to the courthouse, to protest.\n\nPeter Zay/Anadolu Agency/Getty\n\nPerry understood that the judge had exploited racial fears to destroy one of the few places where those fears were addressed, by blacks and whites alike. \u201cIn our space, we actually talked about these differences,\u201d says Perry, who is African-American. He is too young to have lived through segregation. Nevertheless, he grasps that \u201cbusing\u201d has never been about the use of vehicles to transport children to school. \u201cThis is not about busing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about what the end of the ride leads to.\u201d\n\nFor Perry, who still remembers the day integration ended in West Charlotte, we are all worse off for it. After graduating from high school, he went on to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, from which he received both undergraduate and graduate degrees, the latter in social work and counseling. Today, he works with young people in Charlotte-Mecklenburg. Some of them come from the wealthy white suburbs to which parents fled in the 1990s so that their children would not have to attend integrated schools. Instead, these students now attend what Perry calls \u201creal-estate orchestrated\u201d schools, where the pressures of achievement can lead to stress, anxiety and other psychological maladies.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a high-quality education without diversity,\u201d says Perry. The rollback of integration efforts, Perry believes, signals a deeper social breakdown, an atomization of American society. \u201cWe sold our soul,\u201d he says, \u201cand now we\u2019re gonna have to deal with it.\u201d\n\nThe process will likely be painful, just as it was the last time around. Last year, students from Ardrey Kell High School shouted racial slurs at a football game against William A. Hough. \u201cBlack boy, you better watch your back! Black boy, you better keep your head on a swivel!\u201d they screamed, apparently drunk, as middle school students sat nearby.\n\nThe principal of Ardrey Kell apologized, but few were satisfied; many saw the dutiful workings of damage control. Such an incident would have been unthinkable when Perry went to West Charlotte, when it felt like a suture was about to close. Now, it is open again, and the wound is festering. Only the pain is unequally distributed. Ardrey Kell is a majority white school; only 21 percent of the student body is either black or Hispanic. It is widely regarded as one of the best schools around. Hough is mostly white, too.\n\nWest Charlotte, meanwhile, is 99 percent minority and well below state averages on both English and mathematics standardized tests. Once the pride of Charlotte, this high school is now in need of fixing. And Charlotte itself, once the beacon of something hopeful and new, has gone back to its old ways.", "title": "School Segregation in America is as Bad Today as it Was in the 1960s"}, {"url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/923865/earthquake-papua-new-guinea-ring-of-fire-tsunami-warning-latest", "content": "The 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the heart of the island near the near the Southern Highlands area, with tremors felt across the nearby region.\n\nThe phenomenon hit at a depth of 10km at roughly 4am local time (6pm GMT).\n\nA further 26 quakes, all with an average magnitude of five, hit the island in the aftermath of the initial hit.\n\nThere is not thought to have been any damage or injuries cause by the substantial siesmic event.\n\nPapua New Ginuea rests on the so-called 'Ring of Fire' \u2013 a hotbed of seismic activity surrounding a tectonic plate that spans the pacific.\n\nOil and gas companies were forced to immediately suspend operations in the region to assess any danger caused by the quake.", "title": "Papua New Guinea: Huge earthquake strikes Ring of Fire \u2013 7.6 magnitude quake"}, {"url": "https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/02/the-russians-colluded-massively-with-democrats/", "content": "Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton at a campaign event in Charlotte, N.C., July 5, 2016 (Reuters/Jonathan Ernst)\n\nMueller scours Team Trump for Russian collusion as Dems marinate in it\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller and his investigators resemble axe-wielding firefighters frantically stomping through a house and not finding so much as a lit birthday candle. Meanwhile, the home next door burns to the basement.\n\nTeam Mueller\u2019s never-ending hunt for reds in October 2016 has found zero evidence of Russian collusion among Team Trump. In contrast, Russian collusion among Democrats has been as hard to miss as a California wildfire. And yet they still miss it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeam Mueller did find Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2014 and how! The February 16 announcement of federal criminal indictments against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies was a Cold War flashback. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told journalists that Russians close to the Kremlin infiltrated the last presidential campaign \u201cto promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy.\u201d\n\nBut Rosenstein threw a bucket of wet sand onto the Left\u2019s simmering narrative that DJT = KGB. The Russian meddling began in 2014, well before Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign commenced. The Russians promoted Vermont senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s Democratic-primary bid and Green-party nominee Jill Stein\u2019s general-election effort. After Trump won, the Russians organized pro-Trump and anti-Trump demonstrations, once in New York City on the same day. They also staged an anti-Trump rally in Charlotte.\n\nFurthermore, Rosenstein said, \u201cThere is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in the alleged unlawful activity.\u201d Thus far, anyone on Team Trump who might have worked with Russians did so after being hoodwinked, not due to treason \u2014 as Democrats have shouted for more than a year.\n\nAlso, none of this should comfort Hillary Clinton. Rosenstein said: \u201cThere is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.\u201d So, rather than blame Russia for her epic fail, Hillary finally should concede that she lost a mismanaged campaign that barely visited Michigan and avoided Wisconsin as if it had been quarantined.\n\nThroughout these events, the president of the United States was not Donald Trump. It was Barack Obama. He appears to have done little to nothing about this Russian penetration of America\u2019s contest for the White House, other than to tell Putin to \u201ccut it out\u201d at a September 2016 meeting in China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, as if to bury the illusory Russia\u2013Trump nexus even further, a February 7 U.S.-led coalition airstrike on pro-Assad \u201cmercenaries\u201d in eastern Syria killed \u201cseveral dozen\u201d Russians, Moscow admitted. Sending Russians home in boxes is hardly what one would expect from Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cpuppet\u201d in Washington, no matter how much Joy Behar and Rachel Maddow huff and puff to the contrary.\n\nIn short, there is not enough proof of Russian collusion by Trump to fuel a stovetop pilot light.\n\nIn contrast, the evidence of Democratic collusion with Russia blazes on, even as Team Mueller ignores it.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s Russian Reset began in Geneva on March 6, 2009. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton huddled with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, and together they pressed a red button that should have been labeled \u201cReset\u201d in Russian. Instead, Hillary\u2019s aides had mislabeled it with the Russian word for \u201cOverload.\u201d Regardless, once pushed, the button symbolized a red dawn of increasingly cozy U.S.\u2013Russian affairs.\n\nObama announced on September 17, 2009, that he would cancel President George W. Bush\u2019s plan to station missile-defense systems in Poland and the Czech Republic. \u201cThis is a U-turn in U.S. policy,\u201d complained former Czech ambassador to Washington Alexander Vondra. \u201cRussia had furiously opposed the project, claiming it targeted Moscow\u2019s nuclear arsenal,\u201d added Luke Harding and Ian Traynor of London\u2019s Guardian. \u201cObama\u2019s climb-down is likely to be seen by Russia as a victory.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Vladimir Putin applauded Obama\u2019s strategic abandonment of the Poles and Czechs. The Russian strongman said: \u201cI do anticipate that this correct and brave decision will be followed by others.\u201d\n\nPutin soon savored more first-class service on the Russian Collusion Express. Barely a month after shafting Poland and the Czech Republic, Team Obama began to ply Putin with planes. To that end, Hillary jetted to Moscow on October 13, 2009.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted that a new Russian airline, Rosavia, is actively considering the acquisition of Boeing aircraft,\u201d Clinton declared at Moscow\u2019s Boeing Design Center. \u201cThe Ex-Im Bank would welcome an application for financing from Rosavia to support its purchase of Boeing aircraft.\u201d Three days later, the Washington Post reports, \u201cBoeing formally submitted its bid for the Russian deal.\u201d\n\nOn June 1, 2010, the Kremlin-owned Rostekhnologii company \u2014 now Rostec \u2014 decided to purchase up to 50 Boeing 737s for Russia\u2019s national airline, Aeroflot. Price: $3.7 billion.\n\nThat August 17, just ten weeks later, Boeing unveiled a $900,000 gift to the Clinton Foundation to \u201chelp support the reconstruction of Haiti\u2019s public education system\u201d after an earthquake had pulverized that destitute island the previous January.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHillary also promoted Skolkovo, an \u201cinnovation city\u201d near Moscow, backed by Kremlin seed rubles worth some $5 billion.\n\n\u201cAt a long meeting I had with [Russia\u2019s then-president Dimitry] Medvedev outside Moscow in October 2009, he raised his plan to build a high-tech corridor in Russia modeled after our own Silicon Valley,\u201d Hillary explained. \u201cI suggested that he visit the original in California,\u201d she added.\n\nHillary\u2019s State Department arranged for 22 leading U.S. venture capitalists to tour Skolkovo in May 2010. Medvedev, in turn, traversed Silicon Valley the next month.\n\nState persuaded Cisco, Google, and Intel, among others, to join Skolkovo. By 2012, the project boasted 28 \u201cKey Partners\u201d in America, Europe, and Russia. Three-fifths of these organizations donated to the Clinton Foundation or paid Bill Clinton speaking fees. From Russia with Money, an August 2016 paper by the Government Accountability Institute, reported that 17 \u201cKey Partners\u201d contributed between $6.5 million and $23.5 million to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nBut by 2013, the U.S. Army Foreign Military Studies Program warned: \u201cSkolkovo is arguably an overt alternative to clandestine industrial espionage.\u201d Boston-based FBI agent Lucia Ziobro concluded in 2014, \u201cThe FBI believes the true motives of the Russian partners, who are often funded by their government, is to gain access to classified, sensitive, and emerging technology from the companies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile visiting Moscow on March 24, 2010, Hillary justified these actions: \u201cOur goal is to help strengthen Russia.\u201d\n\nShe said this to First Channel TV host Vladimir Pozner, a Soviet-era relic who still communicates in barely accented English \u2014 just as he did when he tried to sell Western audiences on the joys of Communism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosatom, the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation, announced plans on June 8, 2010, to buy a 51.4 percent stake in Uranium One \u2014 a Canadian company whose international assets included some 20 percent of America\u2019s reserves of the active ingredient in atomic reactors and nuclear weapons. This $1.3 billion purchase of a strategic-commodity company required the approval of the mysterious Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Hillary was one of nine federal-agency chiefs on CFIUS (pronounced SIPH-ee-us).\n\nThree weeks later, Bill Clinton keynoted a Moscow conference staged by a Kremlin-tied investment bank that promoted Uranium One\u2019s acquisition. Renaissance Capital paid Clinton $500,000 for his one-hour speech that June 29.\n\nCFIUS\u2019s evaluation of Rosatom\u2019s offer, Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer observed, coincided with \u201ca spontaneous outbreak of philanthropy among eight shareholders in Uranium One.\u201d Then-chairman Ian Telfer gave the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative $3.1 million. Founder Frank Giustra gave the Clinton Foundation $131.3 million. Before, during, and after CFIUS\u2019s review, Schweizer calculates, \u201cshareholders involved in this transaction had transferred approximately $145 million to the Clinton Foundation or its initiatives.\u201d\n\nLeading congressional Republicans rebelled.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this potential takeover of U.S. nuclear resources by a Russian government\u2013owned agency would pose great potential harm to the national security of the United States,\u201d Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, then the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote CFIUS\u2019s then-chairman, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. The top Republicans on the Financial Services, Homeland Security, and Armed Services Committees also signed Ros-Lehtinen\u2019s October 5, 2010, letter, which beseeched CFIUS to \u201cblock the sale.\u201d\n\nAs a CFIUS member, the ever-voluble Hillary could have heeded this red alert and stopped Putin from controlling a fifth of U.S. uranium supplies.\n\nNo such luck.\n\nEighteen days after the GOP\u2019s admonition, CFIUS let Rosatom purchase a majority stake in Uranium One. Subsequent investments pushed the Kremlin\u2019s share of Uranium One to 100 percent by January 2013.\n\nSoon after taking total control of Uranium One, Rosatom CEO Sergei Kiriyenko crowed: \u201cFew could have imagined in the past that we would own 20 percent of U.S. reserves.\u201d\n\nObama clearly signaled the Kremlin that the Russian collusion would continue in his second term. At a March 26, 2012, meeting in Seoul, South Korea, an open microphone captured his conversation with Medvedev, which neither knew was being recorded.\n\nObama asked for Russia\u2019s patience, \u201cparticularly with missile defense.\u201d Obama added: \u201cThis is my last election. . . . After my election, I have more flexibility.\u201d\n\nMedvedev replied: \u201cI will transmit this information to Vladimir.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama got Moscow to rescue him from his Syrian \u201cred line\u201d fiasco.\n\nObama boasted in August 2012 that \u201ca red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized.\u201d\n\nOn August 21, 2013, Syrian dictator Bashar Assad struck rebel-controlled Ghouta with sarin nerve gas, killing hundreds of civilians, including boys and girls. The whole world was watching as Obama did nothing, even after Assad clearly poisoned his way across that red line.\n\nThen\u2013secretary of state John Kerry generated titters that September 8 when he said that America might ruffle Assad with \u201cunbelievably small\u201d air strikes. Kerry also said that day in London that Assad should surrender his chemical weapons and \u201callow a full and total accounting for that.\u201d\n\nMoscow loved the concept.\n\n\u201cWithin an hour, an hour and a half,\u201d Kerry said, \u201cI got a phone call from Sergei Lavrov of Russia suggesting that was a really good idea.\u201d\n\nBy mid-September, the U.S. and Russia agreed that Assad would remain untouched, and Syria would sign the Chemical Weapons Convention and yield its toxins.\n\nWhile doves defended this display of diplomacy and disarmament over resolve and force, this policy certainly increased Russia\u2019s global prestige and regional influence. But ultimately this agreement proved hollow when Assad yet again unleashed chemical weapons on his people last April, killing some 100 civilians. In response, President Trump finally enforced Obama\u2019s red line by raining 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles on Shayrat airfield, whence Assad had perpetrated that chemical assault.\n\nRepublican senators Charles Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina drafted a January 4 criminal referral against former British spy Christopher Steele.\n\n\u201cAccording to the law firm Perkins Coie,\u201d Grassley and Graham wrote, in June 2016, \u201cMr. Steele\u2019s dossier-related efforts were funded through Fusion GPS by that law firm on behalf of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton Campaign.\u201d Steele\u2019s work scored him $160,000.\n\nGrassley and Graham note: \u201cOn the face of the dossier, it appears that Mr. Steele gathered much of his information from Russian government sources inside Russia.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The contents of this \u201csalacious and unproven\u201d dossier (in former FBI chief James Comey\u2019s words) wound up triggering a questionable wiretap on former Trump adviser Carter Page and filling newspapers and broadcasts with anti-Trump propaganda.\n\nSo, the relentless, fruitless quest for Russian collusion among Team Trump instead finds it alive and well among Team Clinton \u2014 and as tough to detect as a May Day march through Red Square.\n\nIf Special Counsel Robert Mueller sincerely wishes to expose Russian collusion in general, rather than search in vain for the Republican strain of this virus, he should scrutinize the other side of the aisle. Democrats colluded with Russia from 2009 to at least 2016. If Mueller has no idea where to look, he might start by connecting the nine dots that appear above.", "title": "Russian Collusion: Democrats, Obama, Hillary Clinton"}, {"url": "http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/03/05/pair-of-4-2-magnitude-quakes-in-oklahoma/", "content": "BRECKENRIDGE, Okla.

Outside the yellow concrete walls of the Caravelle Hotel, Hurricane Maria was hurtling toward shore with Category 5 force. Jon Rose, who had come to the area to implement water-filtration systems in communities already devastated by Hurricane Irma, seemed less alarmed than amused. Since founding his nonprofit, Waves for Water, eight years ago, the 39-year-old had experienced the aftermath of 19 natural disasters, but he\u2019d never been on the ground before one of them struck.\n\nRose stood outside, in an open stairwell, and held up his iPhone so that he and longtime friend and fellow former pro surfer Ben Bourgeois fit in the frame. Instagram needed a video update. \u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Rose said, squinting into the wind and chuckling. \u201cStill standing.\u201d He panned the scene. Palm trees heaved in the distance. Heavy rain streaked through the fluorescent light of a streetlamp. In a second video, Rose led the camera into his hotel room, focusing on clumps of ceiling panels that had fallen into the puddles on the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s all water,\u201d he said.\n\nThe next morning, Rose and Bourgeois, along with Waves for Water\u2019s Haiti director, Fritz Pierre-Louis, stepped outside and into an almost unrecognizable landscape. \u201cIt was like a bomb had gone off,\u201d Bourgeois told me. \u201cThe island had lost all its green.\u201d The damage was just as severe in Puerto Rico, where Rob McQueen, field operations director and head of the organization\u2019s Caribbean Hurricane Relief Initiative, and his team of three were located. Almost the entire island had lost power, and more than half the population was without clean water.\n\nRose\u2019s special-ops-inspired response teams began working their contacts: friends in the Caribbean surfing community, Pierre-Louis\u2019s Rotarian connection in Saint Croix, locals willing to ignore emergency curfews to reach isolated areas. McQueen led the overall operation, which initially consisted of just eight people, from Puerto Rico. \u201cWe did everything from connecting private-plane and helicopter owners to couriers, to flying in people with water filters,\u201d he told me. \u201cFinding ways to get things from outside normal channels is what we do.\u201d\n\nWithin the first 72 hours, nearly all the 500 filters the teams had managed to pack in their checked baggage were being distributed across Saint Croix and Puerto Rico. After three weeks\u2014as the U.S. government came under increasing fire for its ineffective disaster response in Puerto Rico, where 29 percent of the population still lacked potable water\u2014Waves for Water had set up 3,600 filtration systems across seven islands, aiding an estimated 100,000 people. The group had even rented a 50-foot yacht, La Vagabond, to reach Dominica, 250 miles to the southeast of Saint Croix. By October 20, the Caribbean initiative was on pace to be one of Waves for Water\u2019s most successful projects. Through partners and individual donations, it had raised nearly $300,000. Rose credited the organization\u2019s success to its \u201cbreed of guerrilla humanitarianism.\u201d\n\nLast November, I met Rose at NeueHouse, a swanky co-working space off Park Avenue in Manhattan. It was just before lunch, and the palatial World War I\u2013era building was bustling with young men and women direct from urban-creative central casting. I found Rose sitting on a window seat in front of his MacBook. One of NeueHouse\u2019s original members is a friend, so Rose gets a discount on membership, which can run as high as $4,000 a month. \u201cI think they like the idea of having a resident humanitarian,\u201d he told me.\n\nI\u2019d met Rose in 2012, when he came to New York to help friends who lived in communities devastated by Hurricane Sandy. His curly dark brown hair, while still full, was now grayer. In the field, Rose always wears a pair of brown leather boots. (\u201cIt\u2019s a psychological thing about safety. You don\u2019t have control over anything external, but you have control over your response to it, so I\u2019m going to wear boots.\u201d) Now he wore high-top Vans, black jeans, and a black leather jacket over a gray hoodie. As always, he was eager to talk about Waves for Water, though his glassy blue eyes suggested that he could use some extra sleep.\n\nA lot has happened since Sandy, when Waves for Water was barely two years old. Catastrophic floods in Brazil, Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the Nepal earthquake, Hurricane Matthew in Haiti\u2014Rose personally responded to all of them and more. The global water crisis has also grown ever more dire; today nearly one in nine people, some 783 million, are living without access to safe water, while the average American uses about 100 gallons every day.\n\nSuch statistics, and Waves for Water\u2019s reputation for coming through with filters and aid in the most extreme conditions, has attracted partnerships with BMW and PayPal, as well as the United Nations and the U.S. military. Rose\u2019s organization now raises an average of $2 million annually\u2014not only to respond to natural disasters, but also to help people in regions where access to clean water is difficult. Rose moves fluidly around the world on a comfortable salary, split 25-75 between Waves for Water and the clothing company Hurley, which pays him as a brand ambassador. The nonprofit has ten full-time employees, including McQueen and Pierre-Louis, who work remotely from locations around the globe, and about 15 part-time employees, though that number can rise depending on funding, partnerships, and unforeseen disasters.\n\nAt NeueHouse, Rose\u2019s iPhone wouldn\u2019t stop buzzing with notifications. When he\u2019s in New York, which is rarely for more than ten days at a time, he\u2019s buried under the daily responsibilities of heading up an international nonprofit. There are phone conferences with the organization\u2019s four directors around the world. There are potential partnerships to explore, often involving meetings with corporate suits in sparkling high-rises.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready for a break,\u201d Rose said, then clarified: \u201cFrom a certain aspect of the work.\u201d\n\nBefore September 30, 2009, Rose could never have imagined running a global humanitarian-aid organization. That day he was sitting on a boat moored off the city of Padang, Indonesia, just after a surf trip with friends. He was 31. He\u2019d just retired after 13 years as a professional surfer. He and his wife, who he\u2019d been with for eight years, were headed for divorce. Their Laguna Beach, California, condo, which Rose bought at the peak of the real estate bubble, was in foreclosure. As Rose put it, his mind was \u201ca whole world of scrambled eggs.\u201d And then a magnitude-7.6 earthquake hit Padang, reducing much of the city to rubble.\n\nRose\u2019s father, Jack\u2014a carpenter who started a nonprofit to help communities in Kenya and Uganda build rain-catchment systems\u2014had encouraged his son to give back, and the trip to Indonesia seemed like the perfect opportunity. So Rose had packed ten palm-size ceramic water filters, which he intended to donate to a Balinese community he\u2019d visited in the past. He\u2019d even incorporated his mini-initiative, naming it Waves for Water. In Padang, however, Rose found a Red Cross center in desperate need of clean water for treating wounds, so he volunteered his filters. \u201cI found a clarity that I hadn\u2019t had in years, or maybe ever,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, this is what I\u2019m going to dedicate myself to.\u201d\n\nLess than four months later, in January 2010, Rose landed in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, a few days after the deadliest earthquake in the history of the Western Hemisphere, on his first official Waves for Water disaster -response. A private donor had read a news article about Rose\u2019s experience in Padang and offered him $40,000 to rush 4,000 water filters to Haiti. Waves for Water didn\u2019t yet have 501(c)3 status, let alone 4,000 filters, but Rose said he\u2019d do it anyway. He followed a ragtag group of responders to a Port-au-Prince home that had been arranged by the donor and started picking up on the lingo of the international-aid community. The \u201cstructure\u201d had been \u201ccompromised,\u201d so he pitched his tent in the yard. The stench of decomposing bodies hung thick in the air for weeks.\n\nAs it would be in Puerto Rico after Maria, the relief effort in Haiti was bogged down by the bureaucratic red tape of government and large NGOs, which left swaths of the disaster area totally ignored. \u201cI was a one-man show,\u201d Rose recalled. \u201cI wasn\u2019t competing against other organizations, I was competing against the crisis.\u201d He gravitated to other independent responders, like the two paramedics from Florida who commandeered an ambulance to locate the injured and deliver them to hospitals.\n\nRose\u2019s most important connection was Pierre-Louis, a Haitian businessman who seemed to be in possession of the only working BlackBerry in the country and who could coordinate relief to the hardest-hit neighborhoods. It was with Pierre-Louis that Rose perfected the strategy of going directly to needy communities with the filtration systems, each of which involved a filter connected to a five-gallon bucket by a tube and an adapter. (Today, Waves for Water utilizes the same system, made by Sawyer Products, which contains a microfiber cartridge that can catch 99.9 percent of the common bacteria, protozoa, and cysts that cause things like cholera, botulism, typhoid, and dysentery. The filters don\u2019t need to have their cartridges changed and can function for years.) \u201cThe difference between Waves for Water and a lot of large organizations is that when there\u2019s a catastrophe, we don\u2019t spend time in meetings,\u201d Pierre-Louis told me. \u201cIn two days, we are on the ground and getting to the people who are really in need.\u201d\n\nTogether, Rose and Pierre-Louis identified community leaders and taught them how to assemble and maintain the filter systems, to ensure that they would remain effective for years to come. This is how Waves for Water still operates today. \u201cWe remain small on purpose,\u201d Rose told me, referring to the crisis-response teams, which rarely have more than four members. \u201cThe goal for any aid organization should be: have the least amount of international people and the most amount of nationals.\u201d\n\nWaves for Water is no megalith, but it\u2019s having an impact. In eight years, Rose and his teams have distributed more than 150,000 filter systems in 44 countries, helping an estimated seven million people.\n\nThough it\u2019s difficult to find, there has been criticism of Rose\u2019s go-with-anybody approach to aid work. Some people denigrate him for partnering with the U.S. military. \u201cIt\u2019s taboo,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the minds of some aid providers, they\u2019re saving the world and the military is killing it.\u201d Rose also isn\u2019t opposed to teaming up with companies that many other nonprofits refuse to work with. \u201cIf a mining company is willing to throw down and millions of people are going to benefit, I\u2019ll take it\u2014I have an agenda, too.\u201d\n\nWith the exception of Hurricane Sandy, Waves for Water hasn\u2019t responded to any disasters in the United States, a decision that has also sparked disapproval. After deciding to sit out the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, Rose had to issue a statement. \u201cThe last thing we want to be is an \u2018ambulance-chaser\u2019 type org,\u201d he wrote. Additionally, Waves for Water filters were not effective against the heavy metals in Flint\u2019s water, he noted, and fixing the problem\u2014repairing contaminated pipes\u2014was something that the U.S. government could address.\n\nIn the remotest corners of Puerto Rico, where help from FEMA was minimal, Waves for Water\u2019s response, led by McQueen, has been textbook guerrilla humanitarianism\u2014and incredibly effective. Last winter, months after the hurricanes and the media attention that came with them, Waves for Water teams and their networks continued to expand their efforts. In Puerto Rico alone, over 6,000 filters had been distributed to 78 communities. Another 1,700 filters had been implemented across the Caribbean islands, and donations, most of them from individuals, surpassed $620,000.\n\n\n\nRose, however, was not there. He and his girlfriend, Loriann Smoak, who works for a retail tech startup, were spending the final weeks of 2017 in Colorado before signing a lease on a place in Marin County, California. After eight years of working nearly every day, Rose was taking a sabbatical. He loved New York for the \u201cenergy of its hustle,\u201d and I wondered if\u2014and how\u2014he could truly unplug living in the Bay Area. \u201cThat\u2019s the cool thing,\u201d he said, as if on cue. \u201cFrom a business-development standpoint, it\u2019s a market we haven\u2019t even scratched yet.\u201d\n\nAndrew S.

Martin S. Fuentes/Las Vegas Review-Journal\n\nVegas Voices is a weekly series highlighting notable Las Vegans.\n\nKaran Feder has always been fascinated by fashion.\n\n\u201cI was literally one of those girls who made her own Barbie doll outfits,\u201d she notes. \u201cI\u2019ve totally always loved it.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until her first job \u2014 working with legendary costume designer Bob Mackie for musical star Mitzi Gaynor \u2014 that Feder realized her true love wasn\u2019t fashion design but costume design.\n\n\u201cMy third year in college,\u201d at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, where she grew up, \u201cI realized there was a person behind the scenes, designing (costumes). I fell in love with costumes versus fashion, because there was less following the rules.\u201d\n\nAfter going Hollywood \u2014 literally \u2014 Feder, 56, worked on large- and small-screen projects, from \u201cA River Runs Through It\u201d to \u201cThe Golden Girls\u201d and \u201cThe Wonder Years.\u201d\n\nBut a 2004 move from earthquake-shaky Southern California to Southern Nevada (Feder and her entrepreneur husband, Michael Feder, \u201cwere convinced \u2018the big one\u2019 was going to hit\u201d) has given her a whole new world of costumes to explore. Or, more precisely, a whole old world.\n\nAfter moving to Las Vegas, Feder started Entertainment Exhibitions, focusing on entertainment costume preservation and exhibition. And she managed the now-shuttered Liberace Museum\u2019s eye-poppingly extravagant costume collection.\n\nIn 2013, Feder joined the Nevada State Museum, Las Vegas, where she volunteers at least two days a week, overseeing a collection that ranges from 19th century underwear (including crotchless bloomers) to vintage shoes and handbags that have been donated to the museum.\n\nAnother donation, however, dominates Feder\u2019s museum realm: some 8,000 pieces from the Tropicana\u2019s long-running Folies Bergere. The collection has inspired a museum exhibit \u2014 and Feder\u2019s newly published book \u201cThe Folies Bergere in Las Vegas,\u201d which is chock-full of photos documenting the \u201csequined sensation\u2019s\u201d five-decade history.\n\nWe caught up with Feder in her temperature- and humidity-controlled museum workroom, where she\u2019s surrounded by such relics as a 30-pound, peacock-inspired headdress \u2014 dubbed \u201cthe Frickin\u2019 Bird Hat\u201d by the showgirl who first had to wear the precarious piece.\n\nReview-Journal: What makes costumes and costume history so fascinating?\n\nFeder: Working with Mr. (Bob) Mackie and the outrageous things he was doing, he was like my dream designer. So great. So now I\u2019m involved with saving his costumes and I\u2019ve come full circle. Gorgeous showgirl pieces. Especially now in this city, as we transition away from the big spectacular productions. \u2026 Would those costumes ever make an appearance again? The cost of those. In some of my research, I\u2019ve located the budget breakdowns and they were incredibly expensive \u2014 easy, $5,000. Everything was hand-done and it had to last for thousands of performances, on those big stages with hundreds of girls and boys. I feel like I\u2019m really interpreting a sort of lost period of time.\n\nWhat are your duties at the Nevada State Museum, Las Vegas?\n\nMy unofficial title is guest curator of costumes and textiles, (which involves) putting together exhibits, processing individual pieces \u2026 doing conservation work. \u2026 Every costume has its own objective record, including photographs.\n\nWhy is it important to preserve and study costumes from past shows?\n\nI think it says a lot about the people who lived here, the entertainment industry folks (of the \u201950s). They were like the early settlers. They met each other, they got married, they made babies. And when they were done (performing), they opened dance schools. It\u2019s been really fun for me. The people who wore the \u201cFolies Bergere\u201d costumes, these are people who really settled Las Vegas. Show people. Entertainers.\n\nWhat inspired your new book, \u201cThe Folies Bergere in Las Vegas\u201d? And what makes that show special among all the classic Vegas showgirl extravaganzas?\n\nThe book was inspired because the state museum acquired the existing collection from the Tropicana. My responsibility was to figure out what had just been donated to us. \u2026 And the Las Vegas News Bureau had such a fantastic photo archive. \u2026 When I started my research, they had negatives that had never been developed. I was looking at photos that had never been released. \u2026 The reason I think the Folies Bergere is important is because it was a 50-year show. From the time it opened in 1959 to when it closed in 2009, you can understand the evolution of stage costume in a single show.\n\nWhat\u2019s the importance of Las Vegas in theatrical costume history? Are all the great costume shows in the past or are there contemporary examples that can compare with the classic shows?\n\nLas Vegas was unique because of the huge American versions of European cabaret shows. When we have our visual statement of Las Vegas, it is a showgirl. \u2026 Those shows were inspired by Europe, but we expanded the scale. Today our shows are different. I do think it\u2019s a phase. The Cirque shows are incredibly popular, but star vehicles are also very popular, and those are transitioning. With all the chorus boys and chorus girls, there\u2019s still some cabaret. \u2026 I don\u2019t know if people want to see shows like this anymore. Maybe it\u2019s cyclical.\n\nDaily ritual?\n\nYoga\n\nLast show you attended?\n\n\u201cBaz \u2014 A Musical Mash-Up\u201d\n\nBest place to take out-of-town visitors?\n\nBellagio Conservatory\n\nFavorite vacation destination?\n\nPismo Beach, California\n\nFavorite movie?\n\n\u201cAuntie Mame\u201d\n\nContact Carol Cling at ccling@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0272.

Watch this preview.\n\nPreserving historically significant architecture in Los Angeles requires navigating a long and expensive obstacle course. There can be political obstacles, economic obstacles and environmental obstacles. Even homes designed by some of the world's most famous architects don't survive this gauntlet. The Fletcher Residence, designed by Wallace Neff, is the most recent residence to fail the tests of historic preservation. Though the home still stands, the city of Los Angeles issued a demolition permit for the Fletcher Residence in July 2017.\n\nMost of the city's most famous works of architecture are scattered around residential neighborhoods, tucked into the hills of Los Angeles and invisible among the iconic views of the city. Because much of the city's architectural significance is privately owned, the success of preservation often depends on the concern and commitment of private citizens \u2014 property owners, in other words.\n\nAny property owner in possession of an old house can expect to encounter a steady stream of expensive, ongoing maintenance costs. The custom-made quirks of custom-designed homes built in the 20th century only multiple that reality.\n\nFar more lucrative an economic proposition is to tear down the home and build something new. Examples regularly populate Los Angeles real estate news feeds. In August 2017, the current owners of the Chuey House in the Hollywood Hills, designed by Richard Neutra, listed the home for sale as a \"development opportunity,\" without referencing its architectural significance. Redfin estimates the value of that opportunity at over $ 6 million. A similar situation looms in Fairfax, with the 1930s streamline modern house designed by William Kelsing. That home sold earlier in 2017 for $1.6 million, but by the end of the year, Beverly Hills-based developer Ilan Gorodezki had filed plans to demolish the building and construct a new 17-unit condominium building. As real estate reaches prices that would have been unfathomable to the designers of these buildings, the land beneath a historic home in Los Angeles is usually worth more than the house itself.\n\nAmidst the uniquely Los Angeles landscape of architectural heritage mingling side by side with skyrocketing real estate prices, the work of Frank Lloyd Wright stands as a small but deeply informative collection of case studies. Adding a Hollywood-appropriate level of intrigue to the preservation the few buildings Frank Lloyd Wright designed in Southern California: the fact that Frank Lloyd Wright is perhaps the most famous American architect to ever leave behind a legacy, and his work in Southern California during the 1920s represents a unique turn in his career.\n\nDuring his time in Los Angeles, Frank Lloyd Wright designed a series of houses built with extensive use of textile blocks, influenced heavily by the style of Pre-Columbian Central America. The Hollyhock House is perhaps the most visible example of Frank Lloyd Wright's work in Los Angeles, available for public tours on the grounds of the Barnsdall Art Park. Then there's the Ennis House, where an ownership change attracted media attention from 2009 through its purchase in 2011. The Freeman House is now owned by the USC School of Architecture, which is working to bring the house up to earthquake safety standards. The Storer House and the Millard House, the latter located in Pasadena, complete the regional collection of Wright's Pre-Columbian, sometimes also called Mayan Revival, designs.\n\nThroughout his career, Frank Lloyd Wright experimented with ideas in designing organic, site-sensitive homes. In Los Angeles, this pursuit led him to conceive of the textile block \u2014 a design element sourced from the dirt on the site and woven together to also create the structure of the building. These textile blocks, while conceived with the best possible intentions as an experiment in integrating form and function, continue to trouble preservationists in the 21st century.\n\nTake, for example, the Harriet and Samuel Freeman House, which is now owned by and maintained by the Heritage Conservation Programs at the USC School of Architecture. According to Trudi Sandmeier, director of Heritage Conservation Programs, the house offers faculty and students a rare opportunity to pursue new breakthroughs in the conservation of the built environment. \"Whenever you experiment, you don't know how to predict how these materials are going to react, both in the moment and over time,\" explains Sandmeier of the state of the Freeman House. \"Great ideas don't always make great architecture.\"\n\nUSC has spent $1.4 million to stabilize the Freeman House since the Northridge Earthquake, but the return on that investment is not sexy by design standards \u2014 these improvements consist of structural concrete and caissons drive into bedrock below the house. Due to the work of stabilizing the house, it's still \"mid-conservation,\" explains Sandmeier. Repairs and structural elements are visible while historic decorative elements are safely stored away. Tenants live in the house, tasked with protecting the house from the elements. When it rains, they deploy buckets and tarps. The house acts like an architectural petri dish.\n\nThe dirt used on site to create the home's textile blocks were built with aggregate of different sizes, making the resulting textile blocks incredibly porous. When it rains, the blocks \"soak up water like a sponge,\" says Sandmeier. The blocks are tied together with rebar, which adds risk when mixed with water. When the rebar gets wet, it rusts; when rebar rusts, it expands; and when rebar expands, it shatters the blocks. As Sandmeier puts it: \"The house is slowly falling apart from the inside out.\"\n\nThat kind of decay happens to all the textile-block houses, not just the Freeman House, and Frank Lloyd Wright wasn't the only person to design with textile blocks. His son Lloyd Wright followed in his footsteps, designing several very famous textile block-houses, such as the Sowden House and the Samuel-Novarro House.\n\nThe question of preservation \u2014 how to keep the original integrity of the design while ensuring its place in the future \u2014 is repeatedly tested by remnants of Frank Lloyd Wright's legacy. When solutions are discovered and implemented at a Frank Lloyd Wright home, they improve the chances of preservation for many other historically-significant buildings in the region.\n\nThe hard work of preservation \u2014 even for works completed by world-famous architects \u2014 often boils down to finding the kind of property owners, with the will and the resources to keep architectural significant homes in good repair.\n\nOne of Adrian Scott Fine's roles as the director of advocacy for the Los Angeles Conservancy is working with property owners, elected officials and developers to find and connect property owners committed to the cause in place at architecturally-significant buildings. When they match up a property with the right buyer, says Fine, \"it's no longer just an issue of economics; it's finding the right person that really needs to be there to be the next steward.\" Fortunately, says Fine, there's usually a buyer for a home designed by an architect with the stature of Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nThe same hasn't always been true for buildings designed by the architects that followed in Wright's footsteps. The influence of Wright's work stretched long beyond the 1920s through a community of designers that would create one of the most regionally specific design styles of the 20th century \u2014 luminaries such as Wright's son, Lloyd Wright, Rudolph Schindler, Richard Neutra and John Lautner.\n\nAccording to Fine, each preservation scenario offers a unique set of circumstances, and finding the right line between the integrity of the building's original design and its future viability will continue to be determined on a case-by-case basis. The common thread among every house standing in good repair and retaining its original design brilliance, says Fine, is constant care and attention from a good steward for the property.\n\nGood stewardship takes money, however, and both Sandmeier and Fine mention the need for more money to protect the works of Frank Lloyd Wright in Los Angeles. In the case of USC at the Freeman House, lack of funding leaves preservation in a state of academic limbo, which can be frustrating to well-intentioned preservationists. \"It would be more fun if we had more money,\" says Sandmeier. \"We can study it all we want. But until we can actually do some of this stuff, the house continues to decline.\"\n\nPrivate residences, no matter how architecturally significant, don't have access to a lot of public funding. The Mills Act provides a tax break in some cases. When a public agency owns the property, such as the city of Los Angeles with the Hollyhock House, it can be easier to tap into a small supply of grant funding for preservation. In most cases, property owners write the checks and make the decisions about what gets repaired and what gets rebuilt.\n\nResidential properties in Los Angeles have attracted the highest quality design talent for decades now, but Wright's work still stands out as daringly experimental, different, and even alien when compared to other homes in the city. In the 1920s, these textile block homes must have seemed even more alien next to the styles of the time.\n\nThat kind of pedigree is rare \u2014 rare like a Frank Lloyd Wright home \u2014 and rare like the kind of people committed to protecting and preserving these homes against long odds.\n\nTop Image: Storer House | Still from \"Artbound\" S9 E1: That Far Corner - Frank Lloyd Wright in Los Angeles.", "title": "Preserving Frank Lloyd Wright's Place in Los Angeles Architectural History"}, {"url": "://explore/section/q/J.%20Nelson/J.%20Nelson?ned=us", "content": "", "title": ""}, {"url": "http://www.packers.com/news-and-events/article-insider-inbox/article-1/Jordy-Nelson-was-more-than-just-a-receiver/ab26ccad-455b-4f2a-be28-41b7658229e3", "content": "Edwin from Madison, WI\n\nWhat a week, huh?\n\nAnd it\u2019s only Wednesday. Good morning.\n\nJen from Centennial, CO\n\nSorry to see Jordy go. Great guy. What's your favorite Jordy memory?\n\nToo many to count. His breakthrough performance in Super Bowl XLV. His 60-yard game-winning catch in Chicago. When the Jets had absolutely no answer for him during his 209-yard performance in 2014. My favorite interview with him was last year coming back from the ACL tear. Nelson doesn\u2019t like to talk about himself, but you could tell how much it meant to him to get back on the field. That\u2019s a tough road for a receiver north of 30 years old. What he did in 2016 will go down as one of the most remarkable comebacks in Packers history.\n\nTom from Dunkerton, IA\n\nThe Gutekunst era has officially begun.\n\nTuesday was an active day for the Packers, but trust me, Brian Gutekunst doesn\u2019t make these moves hastily. This is the culmination of months of debate inside those meeting rooms.\n\nBrian from Cameron, WI\n\nDays like this are one of the few where I don't envy your job. Jordy will be deeply missed. Keep up the good work, Insiders!\n\nIt doesn\u2019t compare to what these personnel guys go through on a daily basis. The confidence and moxie those individuals have to sign, release and draft players is off the charts. There are no \u201coverall\u201d ratings to go off of like Madden. It\u2019s all instinct and intuition.\n\nJason from Billings, MT\n\nI was elated to see that the Pack plan to sign Graham, but then looked at my phone 20 minutes later to see they cut Jordy. Free agency is a cruel mistress.\n\nJordy Nelson was more than just a receiver to Packers fans. He was everything you could ask for in an ambassador of Packers football. He was a natural leader, even if he didn\u2019t want to be. Well-respected among his peers, Nelson was the Packers\u2019 NFLPA rep for years. He also is humble to a fault. We get tons of emails every day asking about players. Most fans will use last names to quickly reference players in a question or comment \u2013 Rodgers, Bakhtiari, Cobb, Daniels and Montgomery. Nelson was different. To fans, he was simply \u201cJordy.\u201d\n\nMatt from Roseville, MI\n\nWith the Packers cutting Jordy, do you see a replacement on the roster, will they draft one or the possibility of bringing him back on a smaller deal? He was one of my favorite players, sad to see a player of his quality let go.\n\nThe Packers have talented players in the pipeline. Geronimo Allison , Trevor Davis , Michael Clark and DeAngelo Yancey have a golden opportunity in front of them. However, no one player can fill the shoes of Jordy Nelson. He\u2019s a rare breed and I wish him well in whatever the future holds, both personally and professionally.\n\nGreg from Perkasie, PA\n\nJordy was my all-time favorite player. As a fan, it sucks seeing him get cut even more because the majority of his last season was without Rodgers. The connection they had on the field was incredible and I will miss watching it.\n\nWhat those two had was something special. You can\u2019t coach that kind of chemistry. Their decade run together was the longest active partnership between a quarterback and receiver in the NFL. If you\u2019d indulge me, I\u2019d like to share probably my favorite quote from Rodgers about his relationship with Nelson. It\u2019s from an interview I did with him in October 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dry, cerebral-type of humor between the two of us. \u2026 I think we\u2019re both small-town guys. I grew up in small towns across Northern California and he grew up in a small town in Kansas. We both believe in hard work paying off and trying to play this game, and beat people with your brain a lot of times.\u201d Man, did they do a lot of that over the years. They played the game at a higher level than most.\n\nKenton from Rochester, MN\n\nI'm sure your Inbox is flooded with outrage over Jordy's release. And I guess you could include me as well. However, to be fair to Gutekunst, what are the positives of this move? Is it to clear cap space?\n\nIt was strictly a dollars-and-cents move. The Packers needed space and parting ways with Nelson was what the front office felt was the lesser of all evils.\n\nAndy from Walpole, MA\n\nMan, it really is a business, isn't it? Well, we'll miss him and we'll wish him the best wherever he goes. I can't think of a personnel move by the Packers in all the years I've been following them that seems as wrong as this one.\n\nThere\u2019s no question this one stings, but I\u2019d also remind you the Packers once traded a Hall of Fame quarterback to move forward with a relatively unproven Aaron Rodgers . You don\u2019t know until you know, Andy.\n\nMatt from Waunakee, WI\n\nI remember the day Jordy Nelson was drafted. They interviewed the Kansas State coach on TV, he said \"You are going to love that kid up there.\" He could not have been more right. I think I'll enjoy a big bowl of Jordy Flakes this morning.\n\nHe hit it right on the head and Jordy Flakes were pretty good, by the way. I had a box or two myself in my kitchen cabinet.\n\nDonny from Green Bay, WI\n\nIs the release of Nelson a smokescreen, like when the Packers cut A.J. Hawk a few years ago, only to re-sign him the next day at a lower number?\n\nThe Packers cut Hawk in 2011 because of a salary issue related to the final year of his rookie contract, which stemmed from his fifth-overall selection in the pre-CBA era. Ted Thompson even said in the news release announcing the move that Green Bay was \u201chopeful that we can continue to work with\u201d him. This move with Nelson seems more finite.\n\nMark from Illinois\n\nAny chance Jordy gets a new contract?\n\nGutekunst said it\u2019s unlikely at the moment. However, it is worth pointing out James Jones eventually made his way back to Green Bay. \u201cNever say never.\u201d\n\nJoe from Kansas City, MO\n\nWell, Cliff Christl's article on Lombardi being willing to let players go was timely. The decision to let Jordy go may make cap sense, but it's not going to be popular.\n\nThese decisions never are.\n\nJohn from Henderson, KY\n\nGood afternoon. I can only imagine how flooded the Inbox is today. Putting all my emotions aside, I\u2019m curious what factors go into cutting Jordy Nelson rather than trading him for draft picks or another player? I didn\u2019t know if it has something to do with his contract status, or if a trade for another player or pick puts the Packers in an unfavorable condition. Best of luck to Jordy. I\u2019ll sure miss seeing him in green and gold, as will my dog. His name is also Jordy.\n\nYou think you know, but you have no idea. Comments were trickling in throughout the day before news broke\u2026and then earthquake. It\u2019s not as simple to trade a player as some might think. The reality is Nelson will turn 33 in May and is coming off a year in which he had 482 receiving yards in 15 games. Teams prefer to structure their own deals rather than absorbing pre-existing contracts.\n\nTinger from Red Wing, MN\n\nJordy is gone because he made a huge salary last year and gave up when Rodgers got hurt. You cannot do that in this league. He\u2019s been great, will make the Packers HOF in a cakewalk, but he failed to step it up when they needed him to.\n\nThis is the most foolish thing I\u2019ve read. Say what you want about how the season ended for the Packers, but I can assure you Nelson didn\u2019t give up. I mean 14 months ago he played with broken ribs. The guy was the heartbeat of that locker room. He put it on the line each time he stepped on the field. Give up? Give me a break.\n\nDave from Sturgeon Bay, WI\n\nLast name is Nielsen. Named the dog Jordy. We thought that was cute. Not sure what to do now. I\u2019m kinda bummed out.\n\nHey, Jordy Nielsen isn\u2019t going anywhere. Be sure to give him an extra treat today.\n\nRyan from Menomonie, WI\n\nNo matter how much you love the guy and all he stands for, it's still a business, right?\n\nThat\u2019s the unfortunate truth of the matter.\n\nMike from Jacksonville, NC\n\nI guess if you want your team to be more aggressive in free agency, you can\u2019t expect to keep every fan favorite.\n\nAs another commenter \u2013 Scott from Miamisburg, OH \u2013 wrote in last night \u2013 business just got real.\n\nFred from La Crosse, WI\n\nI\u2019ve been an admirer of No. 87 from the time he was drafted. I am hoping the best for him. When a player is released what is the upside for them?\n\nThey\u2019re free to sign wherever they so choose. Nelson, for the first time in his career, is a free agent.\n\nPeter from Madison, WI\n\nYou thought you were done with questions about No. 88 didn\u2019t you?\n\nI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\n\nLeo from Kenosha, WI\n\nWhy do I have to go to the NFL site to get the newest news on the Packers? I would think this site would be the first place to get the news, but I see we waived Nelson and are expected to sign Graham. Not even mentioned on here as of yet. Why, I just don\u2019t get it?\n\nNFL teams aren\u2019t permitted to announce unrestricted free-agent signings until the new league year begins at 3 p.m. CT Wednesday. That\u2019s why Gutekunst wouldn\u2019t address any Damarious Randall questions Tuesday. So hold your horses, Uncle Leo. I will say Graham is a unique talent. Paraphrasing an old Ted Thompson quote, the good lord just didn\u2019t create a whole lot of men who are 6-foot-7, 265 pounds. His track record speaks for itself.\n\nRob from Lafayette, IN\n\nThat D-line, though.\n\nThe Packers used a beefed-up D-line to spur their last defensive turnaround in 2009. This has the makings to follow in those footsteps. Business is about to pick up.\n\nEarl from Cheboygan, MI\n\nWhat is Jeff Janis \u2019 status with GB?\n\nHe\u2019ll be an unrestricted free agent in a few hours. That\u2019s all that\u2019s really known at the moment. There are levels to free agency. It may take some time for Janis\u2019 situation to sort itself out.\n\nDaniel from Eau Claire, WI\n\nAre these next few days an equivalent to journalism hell for sports writers (specifically NFL Network and ESPN writers)? With what's shaping up to be the most active NFL free agency ever, the baseball season starting to heat up, March Madness kicking off, and last and very much least, the beginning of the MLS season. Do sports writers even think about sleep in times like these?\n\nI didn\u2019t. I always was restless. My favorite memory has to be sitting at the kitchen table of espn.com\u2019s Rob Demovsky, my former colleague at the Press-Gazette, in March 2015. I think Bryan Bualga had just re-signed with the Packers, which made for an already long day. I was just about to head home for the night when news broke that Randall Cobb had signed a new four-year deal. So I left Rob\u2019s and headed back to the Press-Gazette office. I wrote that story on like a 20-minute deadline, I believe. The opening day of free agency and night before the final roster reduction were always the two nights I slept the least.\n\nCody from Wisconsin Dells, WI\n\nDoes not having a strong chance at substantial compensatory picks in next year\u2019s draft factor in deciding to sign more free agents this offseason?\n\nThere also have been years when the Packers only lost one significant unrestricted free agent (Casey Hayward in 2016) and still opted to go the way of \u201cstreet\u201d free agents (Jared Cook and Lerentee McCray). This doesn\u2019t appear to be one of those years, though.\n\nJason from Sioux Center, IA\n\nNo question, just a comment: While it hurts to see a guy like Jordy go, and only time will tell if Gute was right, I am encouraged to see that he has the guts to make an unpopular decision if he believes it will benefit the team.\n\nThere\u2019s always a price to improve. Never forget that.\n\nRick from Des Moines, IA\n\nWhat are fans more nervous about during the year, before free agency, before the draft, or before the start of the season?\n\nBefore the season, before free agency and before the draft in that order.\n\nGeorge from North Mankato, MN\n\nIf reports are correct, the Vikings will sign Kirk Cousins to a lucrative contract. More interesting is that they look to be losing three free agent QBs this offseason. Has this ever happened before?\n\nNot for the combined amount of money Sam Bradford, Case Keenum and Teddy Bridgewater reportedly are going to sign for. Monopoly money getting thrown around.\n\nDon from Cedar Rapids, IA\n\nThe Packers gave me very little confidence in their third-down defense last season, whether in short-, medium- or long-yardage situations. How did they end up ranking last year in third-down defense? What do they need to do to improve?\n\nThe Packers finished 28th in third-down defense. I\u2019d say they need more pressure on the quarterback and across-the-board improvement on defending the screen. This D-line could be an X-factor, though.\n\nNicholas from Portland, OR\n\nI know people aren\u2019t high on Kizer, but I watched a highlight reel of his rookie season and the kid can ball. He made some really strong throws (including a few against the Packers). Of course I didn\u2019t see the bad, which I suspect was pretty awful given the winless season, but to me his ceiling looks really high.\n\nKizer was a second-round pick for a reason. He has the talent. A few years ago, people weren\u2019t high on Alex Smith and Case Keenum, either. Now, they\u2019re two of the highest-paid quarterbacks in the game. Experience is the most powerful teacher. Let the guy get some.\n\nRuss from Billings, MT\n\nGentlemen, with Joe Callahan being tendered, one has to believe that the powers must have more faith in him than we were led to believe in 2017. Might there be a three-way competition for the backup job going on after the disappointment last year?\n\nThe Packers did one-year deals with most of their practice-squad signings last season. Tendering Callahan or any of the 10 free agents with fewer than three accrued seasons is just a formality. Callahan has been in the system for (most of) the past two years and deserves a chance to compete.\n\nPat from Howell, NJ\n\nIf the Browns take a QB at No. 1, would you consider trading up with the Giants at No. 2 to select Saquon Barkley despite having Aaron Jones , Jamaal Williams and Ty Montgomery at RB? The Packers have the most picks in the draft (12) and the Giants have the fewest (five).\n\nNo, because the Packers likely would need to move picks from next year\u2019s draft to make it happen. The draft-value chart says New York\u2019s No. 2 pick is worth 2,600 points. The value of all the Packers\u2019 2018 picks combined? 2,002.5.\n\nRobert from Saint Joseph, MI\n\nDo you think there will ever be an NHL or college hockey game played at Lambeau Field?\n\nThere already has been a men\u2019s college hockey game played at Lambeau Field. The University of Wisconsin hosted Ohio State on Feb. 11, 2006. NHL? Maybe someday.\n\nAl from Green Bay, WI\n\nMy phone keeps buzzing with alerts of the latest multi-million dollar free-agent deal. Between that and the occasional work interruption, how am I supposed to get my bracket done?\n\nThe struggle is real.\n\nSean from DeSoto, TX\n\nMike took time off again didn't he\u2026\n\nNo, this time I did\u2026and I paid for it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHAVE A QUESTION?", "title": "Jordy Nelson was more than just a receiver"}, {"url": "https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/974307574630805504", "content": "Tweet with a location\n\nYou can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

In 1980, running against Jimmy Carter, he\u2019d won the state by only 39,000 votes, but it was now morning in America again, and the president was in an appropriately sunny mood as his rally began, shortly after noon, in downtown Charlotte.\n\nAs is customary in politics, Reagan praised his audience, then himself. Soon, he turned to attacking the Democrats, whom he accused of keeping people \u201cin bondage as wards of the state.\u201d They wanted dependents, not citizens. And instead of listening to Americans, liberals would tell Americans what to do.\n\nTo illustrate his point, Reagan alluded to a matter of fierce contention across the South: the court-ordered integration of public schools and the yellow buses that frequently made that integration happen, carrying white children to predominantly black schools and black children to white ones.\n\nBut there was no cheering, no applause, only the stony silence that accompanies an errant note. And when a reaction did come, it was in the form of a Charlotte Observer editorial titled, flatly, \u201cYou Were Wrong, Mr. President.\u201d The paper\u2019s editors chided Reagan, writing that Charlotte\u2019s \u201cproudest achievement of the past 20 years is not the city's impressive new skyline or its strong, growing economy. Its proudest achievement is its fully integrated schools.\u201d\n\nBack then, the claim was true. Charlotte-Mecklenburg (the district includes Charlotte\u2019s surrounding suburbs in Mecklenburg County) had achieved true racial parity in its schools, and had done so without the violence or rancor that accompanied similar efforts, not only in the Deep South but in Northern cities like Boston and Chicago. In Memphis, Tennessee, opponents of integration buried a school bus. In Charlotte, the buses came and went. Long known as the Queen City, Charlotte had an enviable new nickname: \u201cThe city that made desegregation work.\u201d\n\nThe nickname would not apply today. Charlotte, in 2018, looks like most other American cities, where schools are nearly as segregated as they were before the 1954 Supreme Court decision of Brown v. Board of Education, which declared separate but equal schools to be unconstitutional. Some cities, like New York, never really integrated their schools, hiding for decades under the guise of Northern liberalism. Many others complied with court orders, but did so unwillingly and incompletely, without ever convincing people that integration was a public good. Charlotte was the rare city that made its citizens believe in integration, and those citizens in turn made integration work. Their retreat from that experiment has been revealing\u2014and complete.\n\nEarlier this year, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, or CMS, published a report titled \u201cBreaking the Link,\u201d which explored the relationship between poverty and education. A single sentence in the introduction grimly sums up the state of things: \u201cIf you are born poor in Charlotte, you are likely to stay that way.\u201d In a low-poverty school (i.e., a school where less than a quarter of students are eligible for a free lunch and breakfast program), 95.2 percent of students graduate; only 77.6 percent graduate in a high-poverty school, where more than half of students are eligible for free lunch. The latter have younger, less experienced teachers. There are more disciplinary problems at these schools, and test scores are lower.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nThe links between poverty and education also pertain to race. \u201cFor all grade spans, low-poverty schools were composed of mostly white students,\u201d the report\u2019s authors wrote, \u201cwhereas in high-poverty schools, the majority of students were black and Hispanic.\u201d This was the toxic nexus that Charlotte had once tried to dispel. And it did so with success, so that its schools made it onto the front page of The Wall Street Journal in 1991. Only a decade after that, the experiment ended, and now the gains of that time have been squandered.\n\nJames Ferguson is a civil rights lawyer who worked on the legal effort to desegregate Charlotte\u2019s schools. That was 50 years ago. He does not want to believe the work was futile, but a life of fighting discrimination cautions against shows of optimism. History is littered with disappointments, including his own. He was in junior high, at a segregated school in Asheville, North Carolina, when the Supreme Court delivered the Brown ruling. Like many, he thought things would change at once. But they didn\u2019t change at all because people in Birmingham, Alabama weren\u2019t going to take orders from Washington.\n\nThe nation delivered on the promise of Brown only because men and women like Ferguson forced it to, and to have the nation renege on that promise has been crushing. Ferguson is a civil leader in Charlotte, a power broker, and the sadness haunts him; he thought he\u2019d won a battle, when it turns out he lost. \u201cThere is no core of people who are actively pushing for school desegregation,\u201d he laments. \u201cWe\u2019re almost back to where we started from.\u201d\n\nSign up for our Newsletter Sign up\n\nUpdate your preferences \u00bb\n\nWe, in this case, could mean the entire United States. We came closest to integration in 1988, when nearly half of all African-American children attended majority white schools. Since then, districts have been casting off federal court orders like rusted shackles. The result, a Government Accountability Office report found in the spring of 2016, the number of African-American and Hispanic students attending segregated schools is rapidly growing.\n\nCharlotte was never supposed to be among those districts, though. That was the promise of Charlotte. For many decades, it was a promise realized.\n\nFrightened, White and Middle-Class\n\nThe bus may well be the most potent symbol of African-Americans\u2019 struggle for racial equality in the 20th century. In Montgomery, Alabama, a squat yellow-and-lime bus, numbered 2857, became the epicenter of the civil rights movement on December 1, 1955, when seamstress Rosa Parks refused to move toward the back, where blacks were forced to sit. About a decade later, as the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson took up the work of actually enforcing the Brown decision, it was the yellow school bus that became a vehicle of both social progress and deep-seated fears that made that progress so difficult.\n\nMatthew Delmont, the author of Why Busing Failed, has concluded that the first protest by white parents against the use of busing to redress racial imbalances in public schools took place in New York City in 1957. New York was exempt from Brown because its schools were not segregated by law, like those in the Deep South. That made white residents all the more furious, because they felt they had done nothing to segregate schools and should therefore not be forced to integrate them.\n\nJournalists were aware of these fears, and some played to them. A Wall Street Journal article warned that the city\u2019s Board of Education \u201cproposes extensive use of city-financed buses to create racially balanced schools.\u201d Delmont believes this was the first time a national outlet deployed the specter of \u201cbusing\u201d to frighten middle-class whites. (Buses had been transporting children for decades, and plenty of districts were already using racial criteria in zoning decisions to keep schools segregated.)\n\nBettmann Archive/Getty\n\nThe fearmongering worked, and it encouraged newspapers and television stations to report with greater avidity on what came to be known as \u201cforced busing.\u201d Opponents of busing predictably directed their anger at education bureaucrats, whom they accused of social engineering. As one letter to New York\u2019s central schools administration put it, \u201cThe Negro is emerging from ignorance, savagery, disease and total lack of any culture. Is it necessary to foist the Negro on the White Americans for fair play?\u201d\n\nDespite a halting effort at integration that began in 1957, little changed in Charlotte during the 1960s. Busing came to the city only after a 1969 federal district court ruling in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg County Board of Education, a suit brought by an African-American preacher who didn\u2019t understand why his son had to attend effectively segregated schools. The judge in the case was a white Southerner without especially strong liberal convictions. But he also understood that there was no legal standing for those who resisted integration. \u201cWhen racial segregation was required by law, nobody evoked the neighborhood school theory to permit black children to attend white schools closer to where they lived,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere is no reason except emotion\u2026why school buses can not be used\u2026to desegregate the schools.\u201d\n\nAnd so busing began in Charlotte on September 9, 1970, with 525 buses serving as the army of integration. White parents protested, and Charlotte, which claimed to be a city of the \u201cNew South,\u201d anxiously waited to discover whether its claim was anything more than a clever marketing pitch.\n\nGoodbye, White Flight\n\nIntegration turned out to look a lot like war. Mobs welcomed buses carrying black children into white neighborhoods. Whites threw rocks and hurled racial taunts. White children stayed away from schools. On the television sets that now graced nearly every home in the nation, Americans watched and wondered if racial reconciliation would ever be possible.\n\nThe year was 1974, and the city was Boston, not Charlotte. There, a court order mandated that Irish-Americans in South Boston enter into a busing arrangement with black Roxbury. Feeling that they were being bullied into integration by judges and politicians, aggrieved residents of Southie reacted with shows of violence and rage more associated with the Deep South than this city of patricians and academics.\n\nMeanwhile, 840 miles to the south, things were going just fine in Charlotte, now in its fourth year of integrated schooling. Watching the reports from Boston with confusion and dismay, students at West Charlotte High School, which had quickly become the centerpiece of Charlotte\u2019s success, decided to do something novel: They invited students from Boston to come down South, to see that integration could be done peacefully, to the benefit of all students. Five high schools students traveled to Charlotte that November. \u201cI think every KKK member in the South wrote me a personal letter calling me a nigger-lover and threatening me,\u201d recalled West Charlotte Principal Sam Haywood to historian Pamela Grundy many years later. He added, \u201cYou know, if adults had got out of the way, kids could solve most of the problems.\u201d\n\nBut adults had helped solve the problem in Charlotte. Specifically, well-off white adults who seemingly had the least to gain from integration. Some of the city\u2019s leading families decided they would send their children to West Charlotte High School, a sign that they were invested in the integration experiment. Maybe there was something selfish in this, too\u2014a desire to separate Charlotte from symbols of racial strife like Birmingham and Montgomery. Even so, they put their own children on school buses instead of merely watching as middle- and working-class whites did.\n\nAP Photo\n\nEveryone was uneasy about the experiment. As one African-American student recalled years later, \u201c[People] thought it was going to be racial tension every day. \u2018Here we go again. Six o\u2019clock news. A riot at West Charlotte again.\u2019 Never happened.\u201d Whites and blacks made the requisite effort. It wasn\u2019t a seamless union, but the rivets held.\n\nEventually, integration became a normal part of life in Charlotte, which made the city exceptional in the eyes of the nation. During his eight years in the White House, Reagan had appointed 364 judges to the federal bench, many of whom could be expected to execute his conservative, anti-government agenda, which included opposition to busing; his successor, George H.W. Bush, ran a racially divisive campaign predicated on raw fears about black criminality. In March 1991, the video of white police officers beating a black resident of Los Angeles named Rodney King confirmed a new mood of racial hostility\u2014or, even worse, that racial hostility had never gone away.\n\nTwo months after Americans learned of King\u2019s plight, The Wall Street Journal reported on the goings-on at West Charlotte. In a front-page article, the paper praised the school as a \u201cwarm picture of integrated young America,\u201d a hazy but hopeful vision of the type of society we have been trying to realize for half a century. \u201cParticularly in a city with a history of racial confrontation,\u201d the article said, \u201cit does seem extraordinary. In many urban centers, white flight has left school districts overwhelmingly black\u2026. Not Charlotte. Its school board has steadfastly rejected any proposals to end its forced busing program.\u201d\n\nBut by the time that article was published, some were already trying to undo the experiment.\n\n\u2018Race Is Not The Issue\u2019\n\nIn the early morning of January 17, 1994, a massive earthquake shook Los Angeles. After that, Bill Capacchione remembers, his wife said it was time to leave. She was a native of Southern California, and the quake had rattled her. \u201cIf this is not the big one, I don\u2019t want to be around for it,\u201d Capacchione recalls her saying. He offered Phoenix as a relatively close alternative. Too hot, she countered. Capacchione had gone to college in North Carolina, at Campbell University, so he suggested a city 130 miles due west of that school: Charlotte.\n\nAround that time, a lot of people were thinking of moving to Charlotte; it had recently become the third-biggest banking center in the nation, after New York and San Francisco. The same year that Capacchione arrived, The New York Times wrote of Charlotte\u2019s \u201crelentlessly upbeat, look-at-me corporate culture.\u201d The city\u2019s \u201cdowntown, which goes by the appropriately cheery appellation of Uptown, is a vital business center, and its green geography and relaxed, friendly style make it an inviting place,\u201d the article said.\n\nThe new arrivals may have worked in downtown, but they didn\u2019t live there. For the most part, they moved to suburbs to the north and south of the city, where subdivisions seemed to rise overnight. One recent study of land use in the county found that while only 12.5 percent of land in Mecklenburg County had been developed in 1976, 40 years later, that number had nearly quintupled, to 57.6 percent. Even as Charlotte thrived, it was Mecklenburg that grew.\n\nThe newcomers, like the Capacchiones, came from the West and Northeast, where schools were severely segregated, but few blamed racism; the segregation of a city like New York seemed to many like nothing more than a historical accident. There was, in fact, nothing even remotely accidental about the forces that turned Brownsville, Brooklyn, or the South Side of Chicago, into ghettos. But because police there hadn\u2019t disbanded protesters with water cannons, that segregation was easier to ignore.\n\nCharlotte had confronted its segregationist past, and that confrontation resulted in a remarkably successful school system. But to those who hadn\u2019t lived through the early, uncertain years of integration in the 1970s, the busing plan was confounding and not especially welcome. In the suburbs, especially, resistance grew. As early as 1988, a parent complained that Charlotte was \u201ca model for shifting children from one end of the county to the other and not a model for educational excellence by any means.\u201d\n\nSchool officials in Charlotte had sensed a growing resentment toward their integration plan. To fight off the criticisms of whites in the suburbs, they created a number of magnet schools throughout the 1990s, which would draw students from all over the county. (Magnet schools are an attractive solution, promising both academic excellence and integration. But the solution doesn\u2019t scale especially well.)\n\nOne of the popular new magnet programs in Charlotte was Olde Providence Elementary School, to the southeast of the city\u2019s center, which had undergone an expansion in 1992. This was where Capacchione tried to enroll his 6-year-old daughter, Cristina. She was denied admission. Capacchione tried again. But she still didn\u2019t get a spot. On September 5, 1997, Capacchione filed a suit against Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, alleging that his white daughter was discriminated against on the basis of her race and, as he explained from the stand, \u201cfelt she wasn't smart enough to get into Olde Providence.\u201d\n\nLee Lockwood/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty\n\nFive other families joined the suit. They argued that Charlotte had spent 30 years integrating its schools. The work had been so well done, they claimed, it didn\u2019t need to continue any longer. Larry Gauvreau, another recent transplant to Charlotte who joined the suit, judged the school system \u201cfully desegregated\u201d and any suggestion to the contrary \u201cabsurd.\u201d\n\nOn September 9, 1999\u201429 years to the day since busing began\u2014federal Judge Robert Potter issued his ruling in the Capacchione case. As a private citizen, Potter had opposed the initial 1970 desegregation plan. And he was an ally of Jesse Helms, the state\u2019s segregationist U.S. senator. Appointed to the federal bench by Reagan, Potter earned the nickname \u201cMaximum Bob\u201d for his tough sentences. He agreed with Capacchione, writing that, \u201cthe Court is convinced that CMS, to the extent reasonably practicable, has complied with the thirty-year-old desegregation order in good faith; that racial imbalances existing in schools today are no longer vestiges of the dual system; and that it is unlikely that the school board will return to an intentionally-segregative system.\u201d\n\nWith that, Charlotte\u2019s experiment with integration had ended, and the city was ordered to wind down its busing program. \u201cThe decision,\u201d observed The New York Times, \u201cwhich affects about 28,000 students who now ride buses past their neighborhood schools in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District, has enormous symbolic significance for the lingering institution of court-ordered busing.\u201d\n\nKids were now much more likely to go to their neighborhood schools. And since the neighborhoods themselves remained segregated, that means they were much more likely to go school with kids who looked like them. This was to some a problem and to others, who cheered the Potter decision, the whole point.\n\nCapacchione was not in Charlotte to celebrate the Potter decision. His wife missed her family, and the Capacchiones had moved back to Southern California. They live there still, down the coast from Los Angeles, in a city called Torrance. Capacchione says his daughter, Cristina, \u201cwent to neighborhood schools,\u201d to which she was always able to walk. \u201cTo me, race is not the issue,\u201d Capacchione says dispassionately, decisively. \u201cI didn\u2019t think any child should have his or her opportunities limited by race or by where they live.\"\n\nOn the first point, few Americans would disagree, at least in principle. The second assertion is more complex. The entire point of busing was to avoid relegating poor black children to inner-city schools. That couldn\u2019t happen unless parents like Capacchione were willing to give up their own access to superior suburban schools. But they had come to expect their own schools\u2014\u201cneighborhood schools,\u201d a phrase rich with Rockwellian intimations\u2014as a kind of constitutional right. There is no such right, however, any more than there is an inherent right to traffic lights instead of stop signs.\n\nCapacchione seemed confused about why anyone would want to talk about the court\u2019s decision. To him, it was old news. \u201cI probably would do it again,\" he says of his lawsuit. This isn\u2019t bravado. You can hear it in his voice: He has no regrets.\n\nThe Cost of Segregation\n\nKeith Lamont Scott sat in his truck, waiting for his son to arrive on a school bus. The truck was parked in a lot at an apartment complex northeast of downtown Charlotte, in an area that\u2019s largely poor and the schools are mostly black and Latino. It was September 20, 2016, just a little before 4 p.m. Within moments, Scott would be dead.\n\nMembers of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department were in the complex looking for someone else. They said they saw Scott in his vehicle, with a gun. His family insists he was reading. His wife, Rakeyia Scott, took video of what followed. You can see her approaching the several officers who have drawn their guns and surrounded her husband. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot him,\u201d she says.\n\nBut they do. No book was ever found. A gun was. The officer who shot and killed him\u2014Brentley Vinson, a young, black man\u2014was cleared of all charges. Black Lives Matter and other activist groups launched protests that consumed the city for days, as officers in riot gear took to Charlotte\u2019s streets like an invading army. The gleaming jewel of the New South suddenly seemed like its sullied Old South counterparts.\n\nThe part of Charlotte where Scott was killed makes up what is locally known as a \u201ccrescent\u201d of poverty that circles downtown. Several blocks from where Scott was shot is Newell Elementary School, which is 90 percent black or Hispanic; 99.6 of its students are on free or reduced lunch, meaning they live in poverty. Down the road is the Zebulon B. Vance High School, which is 90.7 percent black or Hispanic; 99.8 percent of its population qualifies for free or reduced lunch. The gap in the crescent is to the southeast of Charlotte, where \u201cthe wedge\u201d \u2014 a cluster of affluent suburbs \u2014 grows wider the further into Mecklenburg County it pushes, away from the inner city, into the verdant suburbs where poverty and violence are only the stuff of news reports Scott was killed by two bullets; he was condemned by history and demography, impersonal forces that converged on him on a Friday afternoon.\n\nThose same forces also did their work on Anthony Foxx, only they did so to far more auspicious effect than in Scott\u2019s case. Foxx is 46 today, which means he\u2019s a few years older than Scott when he was killed. He grew up in Charlotte, attending integrated schools there, including West Charlotte High. He went on to Davidson College, one of the best liberal arts schools in the South, and then to New York University for law school. In 2009, he was elected mayor of Charlotte, the youngest person to ever hold that office, and only the second African-American to do so. Four years later, President Barack Obama selected him to serve as head of the federal Transportation Department.\n\n\u201cI think many of the white kids who went to West Charlotte got as much of a taste of the black experience as any white person was likely to get at that time,\u201d he says. \u201cBlack kids like me, we saw whites as our counterparts. It was as equal a position as I\u2019ve been in at any time of my life, even since.\u201d\n\nFoxx warns against mythologizing Charlotte\u2019s integrated past. He remembers, for instance, that there were few African-American students in advanced classes. Still, the impact of the integrated experience has stayed with him. \u201cI think that whites and blacks and others whom I went to school with in those years are certainly more well rounded and understand American culture in a more true light than most of us do,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause they saw, even for a brief period of time, the tapestry that the country has.\u201d\n\nBy the time Foxx became mayor, the Capacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools decision had largely resegregated schools in Charlotte. \u201cNeighborhoods became more segregated following the declaration of unitary status,\u201d says Amy Hawn Nelson, a University of Pennsylvania education researcher who has closely studied Charlotte\u2019s demographics (a school district has reached \u201cunitary status\u201d when it is no longer deemed segregated). The result, Nelson says, was that real estate brokers could lure buyers by promising that their children would be guaranteed a spot in some well-regarded suburban school, since the fear of those children being bussed elsewhere was pretty much gone. And what typically burnishes a school\u2019s reputation? Racial composition, not academic achievement. \u201cEven when you look at school quality metrics, Nelson told me, \u201cwhite families are more likely to pick a white school rather than a high performing school.\u201d\n\nKENT D. JOHNSON/The Charlotte Observer\n\nThere have been efforts by school Charlotte-Mecklenburg superintendents\u2014who are independent of the mayor\u2014to skirt the ruling by creating more magnet schools and implementing \u201cstudent reassignment\u201d plans that modestly push for reintegration. Only the countervailing push is stronger. The internet allows for subatomic analysis of each school\u2019s demographics and academics. If they can get a child into Providence, one of the best high schools in Charlotte, they will. Who wouldn\u2019t? And thanks to Capacchione, they can do so without resorting to a federal lawsuit.\n\nMost of these people are liberals: Mecklenburg County voted for Obama twice, while Hillary Clinton nearly doubled Donald Trump\u2019s vote total in 2016. Yet it is one thing to vote in a school gymnasium for a politician you have never seen, quite another to watch your own child ascend the steps of a yellow bus. It used to be that voting and public education were seen as part of the same set of behaviors collectively called civic participation. No longer so, not when a scholarship to Stanford hangs in the balance. As the education writer Nikole Hannah-Jones has put it: \u201cWe began moving away from the \u2018public\u2019 in public education a long time ago. In fact, treating public schools like a business these days is largely a matter of fact in many places.\u201d Once citizens, we are now customers.\n\nFoxx has watched the city\u2019s resegregation with dismay. What he experienced at West Charlotte should have been the start of something hopeful; instead, it was an ending. \u201cIt\u2019s been interesting to watch my friends at that time more or less revert back to the areas of town they grew up in,\u201d he says.\n\nInteresting, yes, and in the case of Scott, tragic. School resegregation did not kill him, of course, but it contributed to the creation of a dual society. After the Scott killing, the sociologist Clint Smith wrote in The New Yorker that we \u201ccannot disentangle the state-sanctioned school resegregation that poor black students in Charlotte experience from the police killing of a black man waiting for his son to get off the bus from elementary school.\u201d\n\nWe have known as much for a long time. After the civil unrest of the summer of 1967, President Johnson set up a National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, better known as the Kerner Commission. Written as the smoke was still clearing from riots in Newark and Detroit, the Kerner report found many reasons for the unrest, public schools among them. \u201cThe hostility of Negro parents and students toward the school system is generating increasing conflict and causing disruption within many city school districts,\u201d warned the report. It can just as readily serve as context for the rage of Black Lives Matter activists who protested in Charlotte as Scott was being laid to rest.\n\nOur thinking is much more data-driven today, yet as far as school integration is concerned, the conclusions of scholars are not at all different from those of the Kerner Commission. Rucker Johnson, a labor economist at the University of California, Berkeley, has studied the effects of resegregation. In a forthcoming paper, he compared the life outcomes of students who\u2019d gone to integrated schools and those who went to schools were courts had lifted integrated orders. Johnson found that resegregation \u201ccaused significant increases in the likelihood of being arrested, of being convicted of a crime, and being incarcerated in adulthood for African-Americans.\u201d They were also likely to earn less.\n\nAs for whites, who experienced no deleterious effects from integration, Johnson found that resegregation would lead them to \u201chave no racial diversity among their friends in adulthood, to live in neighborhoods in adulthood without racial diversity, to express significantly stronger preferences for same-race partners, and were significantly less likely to have ever been in an interracial relationship.\u201d\n\nJohnson calls resegregation a \u201cmarket failure\u201d because it leads to outcomes that are not only unfavorable but also expensive. It is, after all, much cheaper to educate a child than to incarcerate an adult.\n\n\u2018The Miseducation of Our Kids\u2019\n\nToday, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools are led by Clayton Wilcox, who came to North Carolina from suburban Maryland. Wilcox admits that the kind of muscular integration once conducted in Charlotte is no longer possible. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any appetite except for a very few folks,\u201d Wilcox tells me after I asked about the possibility of bringing busing back. \u201cThe methods of yesterday,\u201d he says, no longer apply. \u201cYou have to create great schools everywhere,\u201d in reference to providing adequate funding to inner-city schools. Research by Johnson of Berkeley confirms that increased spending can ameliorate some, if not all, the effects of resegregation. Then again, spending is as anathema as busing to some.\n\nWilcox was not yet in Charlotte during the Scott shooting or the protests that followed. He references the killing as evidence of something amiss in the city, as well as its schools. \u201cWe are all in this together,\u201d he says. \u201cMany of the things we fear are the result of the miseducation of our kids.\u201d\n\nBut some don\u2019t share that sense of togetherness. Last year, Charlotte-Mecklenburg passed a $922 million bond measure that angered people in the northern reaches of Mecklenburg County, an area that is rapidly growing. No schools will be built there. A local county official named Jim Puckett who opposed the bond measure, believes the shortage of schools in the county\u2019s north (where not everyone is white) was intended to force residents of the suburbs to send their children to schools closer to central Charlotte, integrating them without quite having to say so.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got this angst in the suburbs,\u201d says Puckett. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting the capital resources.\u201d Some of the northern suburbs have even threatened to secede from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, thus creating their own school districts. School secession has become a popular way to avoid integration, especially in states controlled by Republican legislatures that have made it easier for municipalities to cleave from larger school districts. A report published last year by the nonprofit EdBuild found that 71 districts around the nation have tried secession since 2000. More than half have been successful; invariably, these splinter districts are whiter and wealthier than the district they are leaving.\n\n\"Parents tend to be rather self-serving,\u201d says Puckett, the Mecklenburg County official. \u201cThey come to the table with certain beliefs.\" And the prevailing belief in Charlotte, he says, is that the public schools are not working. Whites flee for the suburbs; African-American parents, meanwhile, are choosing charter schools, which have become symbols of voluntary resegregation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the city of Charlotte would ever abandon at-risk kids,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s just not gonna happen.\u201d\n\nIt is more likely that kids will abandon Charlotte\u2019s schools.\n\n\u2018We Sold Our Soul\u2019\n\nThere is a famous photograph that shows Dorothy Counts on the first day of school. It was taken on September 4, 1957, as she walked to Harding High School to start the ninth grade. Counts wears a plaid dress with a long white bow; to her left is her father, in a white shirt and slacks, looking grimly ahead. The two are surrounded by jeering whites. In one of the famous photographs from that morning, white hands make devil horns from behind Counts. She looks off into the distance, mouth askew. She is willfully ignorant of the bigots enveloping her like a thick cloud of mosquitoes.\n\nCounts only wanted to be a student. But because of her race, she was, above all, an agent of integration. She did not last long in Charlotte\u2019s integrated schools. The abuse of local whites had its intended effect, and after several weeks she was shipped off to live with family in Philadelphia. She completed her schooling there. It would be more than a decade until Charlotte seriously started integrating its schools.\n\nToday, Counts (now Dot Counts-Scoggins) lives in Charlotte again. She worked for years in early childhood education but is now retired. Once maligned, she is now celebrated. The library at Harding has been named after her. Charlotte magazine deemed her one of the city\u2019s essential citizens. \u201cIn some ways, we need her now as much as ever,\u201d the magazine said in November, lest Charlotte forget in this age of renewed animosities what it did to her all those years ago.\n\nCounts-Scoggins has not forgotten. \u201cWell, it\u2019s very disappointing to me when I look at what has happened in Charlotte,\u201d she says of the un-integration of the city\u2019s schools. \u201cI tell people, \u2018This didn\u2019t happen in Charlotte overnight. This was something that was happening, and people just sort of ignored it.\u201d\n\nIntegration is difficult work, the work of generations. It may not be especially gratifying to those who must undertake it. Segregation, on the other hand, feels natural enough. Difficult to expel, it is always eager to return. Integration may show its benefits in 50 years, but who wants to wait that long? We are an impatient species, increasingly skeptical of things unseen.\n\nAnd yet segregation takes a toll. Justin Perry was at West Charlotte High when he heard about Judge Potter\u2019s decision in 1999. He remembers leaving school and going downtown, to the courthouse, to protest.\n\nPeter Zay/Anadolu Agency/Getty\n\nPerry understood that the judge had exploited racial fears to destroy one of the few places where those fears were addressed, by blacks and whites alike. \u201cIn our space, we actually talked about these differences,\u201d says Perry, who is African-American. He is too young to have lived through segregation. Nevertheless, he grasps that \u201cbusing\u201d has never been about the use of vehicles to transport children to school. \u201cThis is not about busing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about what the end of the ride leads to.\u201d\n\nFor Perry, who still remembers the day integration ended in West Charlotte, we are all worse off for it. After graduating from high school, he went on to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, from which he received both undergraduate and graduate degrees, the latter in social work and counseling. Today, he works with young people in Charlotte-Mecklenburg. Some of them come from the wealthy white suburbs to which parents fled in the 1990s so that their children would not have to attend integrated schools. Instead, these students now attend what Perry calls \u201creal-estate orchestrated\u201d schools, where the pressures of achievement can lead to stress, anxiety and other psychological maladies.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a high-quality education without diversity,\u201d says Perry. The rollback of integration efforts, Perry believes, signals a deeper social breakdown, an atomization of American society. \u201cWe sold our soul,\u201d he says, \u201cand now we\u2019re gonna have to deal with it.\u201d\n\nThe process will likely be painful, just as it was the last time around. Last year, students from Ardrey Kell High School shouted racial slurs at a football game against William A. Hough. \u201cBlack boy, you better watch your back! Black boy, you better keep your head on a swivel!\u201d they screamed, apparently drunk, as middle school students sat nearby.\n\nThe principal of Ardrey Kell apologized, but few were satisfied; many saw the dutiful workings of damage control. Such an incident would have been unthinkable when Perry went to West Charlotte, when it felt like a suture was about to close. Now, it is open again, and the wound is festering. Only the pain is unequally distributed. Ardrey Kell is a majority white school; only 21 percent of the student body is either black or Hispanic. It is widely regarded as one of the best schools around. Hough is mostly white, too.\n\nWest Charlotte, meanwhile, is 99 percent minority and well below state averages on both English and mathematics standardized tests. Once the pride of Charlotte, this high school is now in need of fixing. And Charlotte itself, once the beacon of something hopeful and new, has gone back to its old ways.", "title": "School Segregation in America is as Bad Today as it Was in the 1960s"}, {"url": "https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/The-deadliest-bridge-collapses-in-U-S-history-12758220.php", "content": "The deadliest bridge collapses in U.S. history\n\nA pedestrian bridge touted for its pioneering construction methodcollapsed Thursdayover a congested road near Miami, killing at least six people, crushing eight vehicles and sending survivors to the hospital.\n\nThe bridge, which weighed more than 950 tons and was still under construction, had been intended to allow Florida International University students to avoid crossing the hectic roadway that divided their campus and the nearby city of Sweetwater. But a different and chaotic scene unfolded about 1:30 p.m. Thursday, when rescue workers raced to free victims from blocks of concrete and fractured metal.\n\nNow Playing:\n\nAn school news release on Saturday hailed the bridge's \"first-of-its kind\" construction that was supposed to reduce \"potential risks to workers, commuters and pedestrians and minimizes traffic interruptions.\"\n\nIt is not yet clear whether design or construction issues played a role in the bridge's failure. Ron Sachs, a spokesman for FIGG Engineering, which designed the bridge, said he could not provide any details as to whether the construction methods were a factor in the collapse. And the director of the Miami-Dade Police Department, Juan Perez, declined to say whether stress tests had been conducted on the bridge.\n\nAmong the five deadliest bridge collapses in United States, flawed planning and execution have led to tragedy. But so have freak accidents.\n\nSilver Bridge, between Point Pleasant, West Virginia, and Gallipolis, Ohio, 1967:\n\nPhoto: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive Workers continue to search the Ohio River scene of a bridge...\n\nLast December marked the 50th anniversary of the collapse of this bridge, built in 1928, which carried as many as 4,000 vehicles over the Ohio River between Ohio and West Virginia each day. The Engineering News Record in 1929 called it \"the first of its type in the United States\" because of its use of eyebars -55-foot-long sections of steel- instead of steel wire cables.\n\nWhile the original design of the two-lane bridge called for conventional wire cables, the eyebar chain design was chosen instead because it was cheaper, according to theWest Virginia Department of Transportation. The Engineering News Record at the time ominously noted that, based on the bridge's design, \"any adjustments in the chains, hangers, or trusses after erection\" would not be possible.\n\nOn Dec. 5, 1967, eyewitnesses heard a loud noise that sounded like a gunshot. In less than 20 seconds, the bridge \"folded like a deck of cards,\" according to theWest Virginia Department of Transportation. Sixty-four people - and 32 vehicles - fell into the river, and 46 people died.\n\nAn investigation into the bridge's collapse found it was spurred by a small stress crack inside the loop of an eyebar, brought on by corrosion, and practically impossible to detect without taking apart the entire eyebar. But taking apart the eyebar would have compromised the bridge's structural integrity.\n\nLaboratory work concluded that, \"With the north . . . chain thus broken, the structure's design made total collapse . . . inevitable.\"\n\nThe absence of the bridge connecting Ohio and West Virginia led to an economic loss of about $1 million a month, prompting President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 to order a federal-state program for its immediate reconstruction. The Silver Memorial Bridge connecting Gallipolis and Henderson, W. Va., was completed in 1969. It still stands today.\n\nSunshine Skyway Bridge, Tampa Bay, Florida, 1980:\n\nPhoto: Keystone, File 1980: Debris from the Sunshine Skyway Bridge perched on the...\n\nWhen the freighter Summit Venture rammed into the Sunshine Skyway Bridge across Tampa Bay, Florida, in 1980, the bridge's structures collapsed, and six cars, a truck and a Greyhound bus plunged 150 feet through steel and iron beams into Tampa Bay,according to NPR. Thirty-five people were killed.\n\nThe new Sunshine Skyway was completed in 1987 and still stands today. This new bridge incorporated safer features: It was higher, for example, and the channel underneath it widened. Large concrete barriers, called \"dolphins,\" were installed to keep ships from hitting the bridge.\n\nHyatt Regency Hotel skywalks, Kansas City, Missouri, 1981:\n\nPhoto: DAN WHITE, AP Workers work to free victims from beneath the wreckage of two...\n\nDecades later, there's almost no indication at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Kansas City, Missouri, that two suspended skywalks plummeted to the hotel's crowded lobby floor during a casual afternoon dance, as the opening bars of Duke Ellington's \"Satin Doll\" played. The collapse killed 111 people and injured 188 in what is still considered the city's bloodiest tragedy.\n\nThe collapse dropped tons of steel, concrete and glass onto dozens of dancing couples,The Washington Post reported at the time. Many of the couples were elderly, partaking in the one-year-old hotel's regular function. The walkway had allowed about 50 people to peer down at the dancing couples from high above.\n\nA government study conducted in February 1982 found that the 32-ton skywalks had barely supported their own weight, and that a change in the original design of the elevated walkways during their construction worsened the issue. Still, even the original design involved a \"load tolerance less than that required by city codes,\" according to The Post. The Post reported:\n\n\"The report said that a decision during construction to change the design 'further aggravated an already critical situation.' The original design had both walkways suspended from the hotel roof by a common set of rods. The design change had the fourth-floor walkway suspended by one set of rods and the second-floor walkway suspended from the walkway above it by another set.\n\nThe design change left the walkways capable of bearing only 21,400 pounds, rather than the 68,000 pounds required under the building code, according to the report.\"\n\nCypress Street Viaduct, Oakland, California, 1989:\n\nPhoto: Michael Macor, AP 1989: In this photo taken Oct. 17, 1989, a pick up truck sits on...\n\n\"Interstate 880, Down and Out in Oakland,\" read the October 1989 headline of aWashington Poststory after the freeway's Cypress Street Viaduct, described as a \"concrete-and-steel leviathan,\" collapsed in a 6.9 magnitude earthquake. Forty-two people were killed.\n\nBuilt in 1957, the concrete roadway's two-tier design was common in California, incorporating complex design calculations (during an era when highway engineers did not use computers) to gauge how much steel was necessary to support the structure. When the roadway collapsed, engineers and geologists determined that its collapse was inevitable.\n\nThe factors that led to the collapse, The Post reported, included the structure's \"hinge joints,\" used to add flexibility to the structure:\n\n\"1) 'Hinge joints' were included in the freeway's column design to absorb weight and vertical movement caused by traffic. But during the Loma Prieta quake the ground also shook laterally, creating stress the hinge joints could not withstand.\n\n\"2) Few steel reinforcing rods snaked up through the joints. The upper and lower columns are honeycombed with these \"rebars,\" but the hinge joints contain only a few.\n\n\"3) During the quake, the columns acted like weak legs on a wobbly table. The lateral movement caused them to snap outward at the weakest point - the hinge joints - freeing the upper deck to pancake down onto the lower one.\"\n\nBig Bayou Canot Bridge, Mobile, Alabama, 1993:\n\nPhoto: Mark Foley/AP FILE - This Sept. 22, 1993 file photo shows the wreckage of the...\n\nWhen Amtrak's Sunset Limited train crossed the Big Bayou Canot Bridge in Mobile, Alabama, in September 1993, the train derailed, sending three locomotives and four front cars plunging into the creek. It was about 3 a.m.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post's Mary Jordan and William Booth:\n\n\"In the water, passengers floundering in the bayou could be heard yelling, warning each other, 'Don't light any matches!' as diesel fuel poured onto the water.\n\n\"About 100 of the survivors filed out of the back of the train in the panic of the dark. For dozens of others, the only way to safety was jumping into the bayou, where water rose well above their heads.

It got lost in the dark and wandered into the bayou. It is suspected that one of the barges slammed into the bridge, bending the track about three feet off its center.", "title": "The deadliest bridge collapses in U.S. history"}, {"url": "https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/02/spacex-falcon-9-paz-launch-starlink-demo-new-fairing/", "content": "SpaceX has launched with the debuting of an upgraded payload fairing for the Falcon 9 rocket during Spain\u2019s Paz satellite lofting from Vandenberg Air Force Base on Thursday. The launch, scrubbed on Wednesday due to Upper Level Winds, also carried the first demonstration satellites for SpaceX\u2019s own satellite internet constellation. Launch occurred at an instantaneous launch opportunity at 06:17 Pacific Time (14:17 UTC).\n\n\n\nPaz is a radar imaging satellite which will be operated by Spanish company Hisdesat. The spacecraft will provide day and night, all-weather imaging capabilities for Hisdesat\u2019s customer, Spain\u2019s Ministry of Defence.\n\nThe launch of Paz had previously been scheduled to take place last Sunday. However, SpaceX announced a delay on Saturday to the next available date: Wednesday. That attempt was scrubbed due to Upper Level Winds being just above the acceptable limits. However, Thursday\u2019s countdown was issue-free.\n\nSpaceX confirmed that the rocket would fly with an upgraded payload fairing and that the reason for the initial delay was to give additional time for checkouts on this part of the vehicle. This was unrelated to the weather scrub on Wednesday.\n\nThe upgrade is understood \u2013 although unconfirmed by SpaceX \u2013 to be Fairing Version 2 \u2013 or \u201cFairing 2.0\u201d \u2013 a new version of the protective shroud expected to improve its survivability for post-launch recovery attempts, and to be reusable on future missions.\n\nMounted at the top of Falcon 9\u2019s second stage, the payload fairing maintains the rocket\u2019s aerodynamic profile and protects the payload from Earth\u2019s atmosphere during the initial stages of the ascent towards space. It is split into two halves, which separate down the middle.\n\nThe fairing \u2013 which has an estimated cost of about six million dollars \u2013 is discarded to save weight once the rocket reaches space. With traditional expendable rockets, the fairing will burn up in the atmosphere or fall downrange of the launch site.\n\nHaving achieved incredible success with recovering and re-using Falcon 9\u2019s first stage, SpaceX has now turned their attention to doing the same the fairing. The company has already achieved some success during testing with Falcon 9\u2019s standard fairing \u2013 including bringing part of the fairing back to shore after a controlled landing at sea during the SES-10 launch last April.\n\nDuring a press conference following the recent Falcon Heavy launch, SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk described developing the recovery process for the fairing as having proven \u201csurprisingly difficult\u201d, but that he expected SpaceX to solve the remaining problems within six months.\n\nThe launch was expected to see another attempt to return at least half of the fairing to Earth. After separation, one or both sections of the fairing will reorient themselves for reentry into the atmosphere.\n\nAs the fairing halves descend, they will deploy parachutes to slow their fall and guide themselves towards a recovery boat which will be maneuvered into position underneath.\n\nThe ship, named Mr. Steven, was outfitted with four large metal arms for recovery operations, which Elon Musk described as a \u201cgiant catcher\u2019s mitt\u201d. Although Mr. Steven put to sea in support of December\u2019s Iridium-NEXT launch, it has been seen for the first time with a net suspended between the arms ahead of the launch.\n\nThis suggested an attempt to land half of the fairing aboard Mr. Steven was on the cards. Mr. Steven left the Port of Los Angeles at 11:39 Pacific Time (19:39 UTC) on Tuesday.\n\nThe test was unsuccessful in that Mr. Steven didn\u2019t catch the fairing, but the catch only missed by a few hundred meters, according to Elon Musk. The fairing did survive, however.\n\nJust a fairing floating in the water. Nothing to see here. #SpaceX pic.twitter.com/zE0CysBPCF \u2014 Michael Baylor (@nextspaceflight) February 22, 2018\n\nAlthough SpaceX\u2019s attempt to recover part of the fairing is another new effort from the company, one thing that was not to be recovered was the rocket\u2019s first stage \u2013 or core. Although the payload is not sufficiently heavy to require a fully-expendable rocket, the core would not be suitable for reuse on any future launches so the call was to dispose of by allowing it to fall into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe core was outfitted with grid fins, but not landing legs, which suggested that SpaceX may still use it to perform a controlled descent into the water. During last month\u2019s GovSat-1 launch from Cape Canaveral an expendable first stage was used to test a new landing burn technique and unexpectedly survived a soft landing in the Atlantic \u2013 although it was subsequently scuttled as it could not safely be returned to shore.\n\nHowever, it appeared this booster was always destined for a destructive return and discarded, per later comments from SpaceX.\n\nThe core that powered this mission was B1038.2, a flight-proven \u2013 or previously-flown \u2013 booster which was also used in last August\u2019s launch of Taiwan\u2019s Formosat-5 satellite. B1038 was the final Falcon 9 first stage to be built to the Block 3 specification, before an upgraded Block 4 version was introduced.\n\nAs well as being the last Block 3 core to be built, B1038 was also expected to be the last Block 3 to fly. Following the debut of the improved Block 4 version with last August\u2019s CRS-12 launch, all subsequent new cores have adhered to this standard. In order to ensure reliability SpaceX has opted not to fly block 3 cores more than twice, and B1038 was the last remaining block 3 core yet to make its second flight.\n\nThe primary payload is Paz, a radar imaging satellite that was being carried for Spain\u2019s Hisdesat. Paz carries an X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system, intended to form one half of the Programa Nacional de Observaci\u00f3n de la Tierra por Sat\u00e9lite (PNOTS), or National Programme for Earth Observation by Satellite. A second satellite, Ingenio, carries an optical imaging payload. This has not yet been manifested for launch.\n\nPaz \u2013 Spanish for \u201cpeace\u201d \u2013 was originally named SEOSAR. It was built by Airbus Defence and Space (Spain), which absorbed the original prime contractor, EADS CASA Espacio, in 2009. The satellite is built around the AstroBus platform and is based on two earlier radar imaging satellites \u2013 TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X \u2013 which were built by EADS Astrium for Germany\u2019s national space center. TerraSAR-X has been in orbit since June 2007, while TanDEM-X was launched three years later, and both satellites have now exceeded their five-year design lives but remain in service.\n\nPaz will be co-located with these two spacecraft in a sun-synchronous low Earth orbit, enabling combined observations between the missions. The target orbit for the Paz mission is approximately circular, at an altitude of 514 kilometers (319 miles, 278 nautical miles) and an inclination of 97.44 degrees, with a local time of ascending node (LTAN) of 18:00. This orbit allows the satellite to revisit a point on the planet\u2019s surface every 167 orbits, or 11 days.\n\nThe Paz satellite has a mass at launch of 1,341 kilograms (2,956 pounds), and a dry mass (without fuel) of 1,282 kilograms (2,826 lb). Paz is designed to operate for at least seven years, although Hisdesat is hopeful that its mission can be extended to ten years. It has a hexagonal prism shape, measuring five meters in length and 2.4 meters in diameter (16 by 7.9 feet), with a surface-mounted solar panel equipped with triple-junction gallium arsenide cells providing 850 watts of power.\n\nThe spacecraft\u2019s imaging payload, PAZ-SAR, incorporates a 4.8-by-0.7-metre (15.7-by-2.3-foot) antenna. The x-band radar imaging payload will operate at a wavelength of 3.1 centimeters (1.2 inches), or a frequency of 9.65 gigahertz. It can operate in strip-mapping, scanning, spotlight and high-resolution spotlight modes. In high-resolution spotlight mode, the satellite can achieve sub-meter resolutions imaging 25-square-kilometer (9.65-square-mile) regions on the surface.\n\nThe launch marked the end of a long road to the launch pad for Paz, which was originally to have been launched by Russia\u2019s ISC Kosmotras. Like TerraSAR and TanDEM, the satellite was to have flown aboard a Dnepr rocket, with the launch to have taken place from the Dombarovsky missile base near the Russian town of Yasny. Dnepr launches were stopped after 2015: the rocket was based on decommissioned R-36M missiles, whose manufacturers \u2013 the Yuzhnoye design bureau and Yuzhmash manufacturing plant \u2013 had been located in Ukraine since the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe fallout from Russia\u2019s 2014 military intervention in Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea led to planned Dnepr launches being delayed and now Dnepr looks unlikely ever to fly again. After canceling their contract with Kosmotras in 2016, Hisdesat announced in early 2017 that SpaceX would be launching Paz aboard a Falcon 9.\n\nPaz was joined aboard Falcon 9 by MicroSat-2a and 2b, a pair of 400-kilogram (880 lb) demonstration satellites for SpaceX\u2019s planned Starlink internet constellation. The satellites are the first prototypes in a fleet which may consist of up to 12,000 spacecraft.\n\nSpaceX first announced Starlink in early 2015. The project will use satellites in place of traditional infrastructure to help provide high-speed broadband internet access around the world. SpaceX\u2019s filings with the US Federal Communications Commission indicate that the constellation will be used for fixed satellite services (FSS), such as backhaul for transmitting data around the globe. The space-based architecture could be used to help bring faster internet access to more remote regions of the planet in the future.\n\nThe Starlink constellation will consist of Ka- and Ku-band satellites orbiting at an altitude around 1,200 kilometers (750 miles, 650 nautical miles) and V-band satellites orbiting considerably lower \u2013 at around 340 kilometers (210 miles, 180 nautical miles). SpaceX aims to have Starlink fully operational by 2024, with the final operational constellation expected to contain 4,425 satellites across 83 planes in the higher orbit, with a further 7,518 satellites in the lower orbits.\n\nThe MicroSat-2a and 2b demonstration satellites carry Ku-band payloads. They were expected to be deployed into approximately the same orbit as Paz.\n\nFirst two Starlink demo satellites, called Tintin A & B, deployed and communicating to Earth stations pic.twitter.com/TfI53wHEtz \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 22, 2018\n\nIn showing footage of their deployment, Elon Musk also revealed their names: Tintin.\n\nFor this mission, Falcon lifted off from Space Launch Complex 4E at California\u2019s Vandenberg Air Force Base. Originally built as part of the US Navy\u2019s Point Arguello launch site, SLC-4E became part of the adjacent Vandenberg Air Force Base when the two launch sites merged in 1964.\n\nThe pad saw its first launch a few weeks after the merger, with an Atlas SLV-3 Agena-D deploying a KH-7 GAMBIT reconnaissance satellite. The pad was used by Atlas-Agena vehicles until June 1967, when the Atlas-Agena ended regular launches from the West Coast.\n\nFour years later the pad returned to service with the maiden flight of the Titan III(23)D rocket. SLC-4E was the only pad at Vandenberg to support the heavy-lift versions of Titan, which continued to use the pad until October 2005, when the Titan rocket family\u2019s final flight \u2013 made by a Titan IV(404)B \u2013 lifted off from SLC-4E.\n\nA second pad at Space Launch Complex 4, SLC-4W, was also built as part of Point Arguello. It initially supported Atlas launches before transitioning to smaller versions of the Titan rocket \u2013 the Titan IIIB and later Titan II(23)G. SpaceX leased both pads from the US Air Force, tearing down the Titan launch facilities and configuring SLC-4E for Falcon 9 launches.\n\nSLC-4W has been converted into a landing pad to support future return-to-launch-site (RTLS) booster recovery. However, this has yet to be attempted at Vandenberg.\n\nFalcon 9 is a two-stage rocket which first flew in 2010. This mission was its forty-ninth launch \u2013 not including the Falcon Heavy that flew earlier this month, which is based on the Falcon 9 but with two additional first-stage boosters strapped either side of a reinforced central core.\n\nFalcon 9 has completed its forty-eight previous missions with only one failure \u2013 during June 2015\u2019s launch of the CRS-7 resupply mission to the International Space Station. Another Falcon 9 was lost in September 2016 during fuelling ahead of a static fire ground test, two days ahead of its planned launch.\n\nFalcon\u2019s first stage is powered by nine Merlin-1D engines, which burn RP-1 kerosene propellant oxidized by subcooled liquid oxygen. The process of subcooling the oxidizer was introduced in late 2015 with the Falcon 9 v1.2, or \u201cFull Thrust\u201d, revision of the rocket, which will be used in its Block 3 form for the launch. It is the third major revision of the Falcon 9 design, after the original version \u2013 now retrospectively known as v1.0 \u2013 and the Falcon 9 v1.1.\n\nThe nine engines ignite three seconds before Falcon\u2019s planned liftoff. These build up to full thrust and undergo checkout before the rocket is released to begin its ascent towards orbit. Seventy-seven seconds after liftoff Falcon passed through the area of maximum dynamic pressure, or Max-Q.\n\nThe first stage \u2013 Core 1038 \u2013 burned for the first two minutes and 29 seconds of the flight before reaching main engine cutoff, or MECO. The nine engines shut down, with stage separation occurring four seconds later. The second stage\u2019s single Merlin Vacuum (MVac) engine \u2013 a version of the Merlin-1D optimized to operate in the vacuum of space \u2013 ignited seven seconds after stage separation.\n\nAlthough SpaceX has confirmed that Core 1038 was not to be recovered, and the stage is not equipped with landing legs, it was sporting grid fins. The stage may perform some or all of the three post-separation burns that are conducted on missions where the stage is recovered \u2013 possibly guiding itself to a soft landing in the Pacific Ocean that would allow SpaceX to experiment with different landing techniques for future flights. The second stage continued on to orbit with its payload.\n\nFor this launch, the second stage only needed to make a single burn to place Paz into orbit. This burn lasted six minutes and eighteen seconds, with separation of Falcon\u2019s payload fairing taking place sixteen seconds after ignition. Two minutes after the end of the burn, Paz separated from the upper stage to begin its mission. SpaceX had not confirmed at what point in the mission the two Starlink satellites will separate.\n\nThis launch was the first for SpaceX since their first test launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket at the beginning of the month.\n\nThe heavy-lift vehicle, based on the Falcon 9, performed successfully and placed Elon Musk\u2019s old Tesla Roadster car into a heliocentric orbit that will take it out as far as the asteroid belt.\n\nPaz was SpaceX\u2019s fourth launch of 2018, following the Falcon Heavy mission and two Falcon 9 flights in January that carried the Zuma spacecraft for Northrop Grumman and GovSat-1 for LuxGovSat and its parent company SES.\n\nThe Paz mission was the first of two SpaceX launches in February with Spanish payloads. The second, which will carry the HispaSat 30W-6 communications satellite into geostationary transfer orbit, is due to lift off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in the early hours of next Sunday morning.", "title": "SpaceX launches Falcon 9 with PAZ, Starlink demo and new fairing \u2013 NASASpaceFlight.com"}, {"url": "http://www.newsweek.com/chris-hondros-photojournalism-war-photographer-tim-hetherington-getty-images-821858", "content": "\"The problem with war photography is that there is absolutely no way to do it from a distance.

To hear more feature stories, download the Audm app for your iPhone.\n\nWhen Roberto Escobar was the head accountant for the Medell\u00edn cartel, in the nineteen-eighties, he handled billions of dollars a year\u2014so much cash that he sometimes resorted to stuffing it in plastic bags and burying it in the countryside. Known as El Osito, or Little Bear, he was the older brother of the narcotrafficker Pablo Escobar, who was then among the richest men in the world, responsible for a drug-smuggling empire that extended from Colombia to a dozen other countries. Although Roberto was never as extravagant as his brother, he was accustomed to flying on private jets, and sent his children to a Swiss boarding school. Once, during an extended hike through the forest to elude capture, he threw a briefcase containing a hundred thousand dollars into a river, because it was heavy. These days, Roberto Escobar, having served fourteen years in prison, earns money by leading tourists around one of his family\u2019s former safe houses. The house, a bungalow of white painted brick, can be reached by a gated driveway off a steep mountain road, roughly halfway between the Envigado plateau, where Pablo Escobar grew up, and the middle-class neighborhood in Medell\u00edn where he was gunned down by Colombian police, in 1993. One recent morning, a group of visitors from the United States and Europe arrived in a chauffeured van\u2014part of a growing influx of narcoturistas, who come to see the places where Pablo Escobar lived and worked. Roberto, seventy-one, still looked like an accountant; he wore khakis, a blue short-sleeved shirt, and thick-rimmed spectacles. While he was in prison, a letter bomb delivered to his cell exploded, leaving him blind in his right eye and deaf in his right ear. His damaged eye was a milky blue, and he periodically squirted drops of medicine into it. Roberto was a gruff tour guide, hustling guests from room to room, but his visitors seemed too awestruck to complain. An exterior wall was speckled with ragged bullet holes, the result of a kidnapping attempt. Inside, a Jet Ski\u2014supposedly one that Roger Moore used in a James Bond film\u2014sat near a photograph of Escobar driving it across bright-blue water. Beneath a writing desk in the living room, Escobar lifted a plank to reveal a hidden compartment. \u201cWe could fit two million dollars there,\u201d he said, then peremptorily dropped the plank. In the dining room, he pointed to an oil painting of a brown stallion, a racehorse named Earthquake. Angrily, he recounted how enemies had stolen the horse from him and returned it castrated. Shaking his head, he said, \u201cNo act of violence is justified.\u201d In 2014, Roberto founded a holding company, Escobar, Inc., to license the family name. But he is a minor player in a growing industry. An increasing number of people who knew Pablo Escobar\u2014employees, relatives, and enemies\u2014are trying to sell versions of his epic life and death, encouraging a cottage industry of books, television shows, and documentaries. Along with the narcotours that operate out of Medell\u00edn, there are souvenir venders selling Escobar baseball caps, ashtrays, mugs, and key rings; Escobar T-shirts are displayed next to soccer jerseys and Pope Francis memorabilia. In the past few years, Hollywood has examined his story in a series of films: \u201cEscobar: Paradise Lost\u201d (Benicio Del Toro; innocent surfer drawn into drug web), \u201cThe Infiltrator\u201d (Bryan Cranston; double agent), \u201cLoving Pablo\u201d (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Javier Bardem; clandestine romance with kingpin), and \u201cAmerican Made\u201d (Tom Cruise; pilot turns Escobar crony turns informant). The depiction most responsible for the tourist boom is the Netflix series \u201cNarcos,\u201d in which the Brazilian actor Wagner Moura plays Escobar as both psychopath and doting family man\u2014a Latin American Tony Soprano. Netflix does not disclose viewership numbers, but the audience for the show, which will launch its fourth season this year, has been estimated at three million. In 2016, Escobar, Inc., sent a letter to Netflix, demanding reparations for appropriating the family story; in a subsequent interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Roberto said that if he wasn\u2019t paid a billion dollars he would \u201cclose their little show.\u201d (Escobar and Netflix declined to comment on the possibility of a settlement.) No one disputes that Pablo Escobar was a murderer, a torturer, and a kidnapper. But he was loved by many in Medell\u00edn, and, increasingly, he is an object of fascination abroad. At his zenith, he was the most notorious outlaw on the planet, with control of some eighty per cent of the cocaine entering the U.S. and of a fortune estimated at three billion dollars. In many respects, he remains Colombia\u2019s most famous citizen, a charismatic entrepreneur of boundless ambition who delighted in his Robin Hood image, even as he killed thousands of people to subvert the government. In Colombia, his legacy touches nearly everyone, but few people agree on whether his story should be seen as entertainment or as a cautionary tale. At the end of the tour, Roberto posed for selfies with visitors and autographed photos of Escobar, along with copies of his memoir, a slim volume titled \u201cMy Brother Pablo.\u201d (\u201cMy mother still recalls that, from the time he was a little boy, Pablo used to tell her, \u2018I want to be a lawyer and have a good car.\u2019 \u201d) The tourists handed payments to a group of wolfish young men who served as Roberto\u2019s assistants. Before I left, I asked him why his brother continued to inspire people around the world. \u201cIt\u2019s because Pablo helped the poorest people of this country,\u201d he replied. It was a kind of catechism; he did not explain further. When I asked if his brother was a good man, he shrugged and said, \u201cTo me he was.\u201d\n\nIn the old city center of Medell\u00edn is a street of funeral parlors. On a bright morning, I went there to meet Jes\u00fas Correa, an employee at one of the funeral homes and one of the first people to appreciate the mythic quality of Escobar\u2019s life. Correa, an amiable man of sixty-three, was bald and corpulent, and dressed in a gray suit, a pink shirt, and a burgundy tie. He took me for a walk, and, two blocks from the funeral home, we came to an open-air caf\u00e9, painted bright yellow and orange, where men sat drinking beer and watching soccer on television. \u201cHere is where it all began,\u201d Correa said. In the early seventies, the caf\u00e9 was called Las Dos Tortugas\u2014the Two Turtles\u2014and it was a favored meeting place for robbers and smugglers. A dropout from Medell\u00edn\u2019s Universidad Aut\u00f3noma, Escobar had gone into business selling stolen tombstones and contraband American cigarettes. He began hanging out with the crowd at Las Dos Tortugas, coming and going on a Lambretta motorbike. Colombia\u2019s drug trade was flourishing, although in those days it was mostly marijuana, which the locals called marimba. Escobar found his niche as the U.S. cocaine market began to take off. Correa ran his own hustle out of the funeral home, which was owned by a friend: he bought contraband French perfume from a contact in Panama, then sold it in Medell\u00edn. One day, one of Escobar\u2019s pistoleros\u2014low-level shooters\u2014summoned him to Las Dos Tortugas and asked if he could get Cartier and Chanel. When Correa assured him he could, the pistolero gave him an order. After that, the gangsters started buying perfume for their girlfriends, and Correa became known as El Perfumero. Correa took pleasure in associating with men who had monikers like Filth and Spider. The cartel\u2019s sicarios, or hit men, operated out of an oil-change shop not far from the funeral home; a group of more than a hundred gathered there to plot killings, kidnappings, and bombings. Some were policemen, who came to change out of their uniforms and then attack their colleagues. Correa was fascinated, and gradually he became a welcome visitor. \u201cWhy did I do it?\u201d he said. \u201cOut of prurient interest, I think, pure and simple. As a boy, I read a book about the Untouchables of Eliot Ness, and I was magnetized by the Chicago gangsters of the time\u2014Al Capone, Pretty Boy Floyd, John Dillinger, Machine Gun Kelly. With the criminals I was getting to know here, I thought, One day I\u2019ll write a book. My friends warned me that I would be dead within six months.\u201d One day, he recalled, some Escobar men began discussing a murder they were planning. \u201cI got up, as if to leave the room, but one of them said, \u2018Stay. We trust you.\u2019 I stayed.\u201d Correa realized that he had crossed a line. \u201cI\u2019m a big reader of World War Two histories,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd something I\u2019ve always noticed is that, for those who were in the concentration camps, a moment comes when they became accustomed to everything going on around them.\u201d Correa waved to the streets around us. \u201cI mean, I suffered over what was happening, the violence. But the morbid curiosity\u2014you know, it was like Alka-Seltzer. I felt something here, inside me.\u201d Correa made an itching motion with his fingers around his stomach, and smiled. When Escobar began to establish himself as a public figure, in the early eighties, he found other people willing to tell his story without judgment. In April, 1983, the weekly magazine Semana published an article titled \u201cUn Robin Hood Paisa.\u201d (Paisa is the local term for the people of Antioquia province, which contains Medell\u00edn.) Semana described Escobar as a politically ambitious and civic-minded thirty-three-year-old businessman who owned an immense private ranch and a fleet of helicopters and airplanes. The magazine evaded questions about the origin of Escobar\u2019s fortune, saying only that it was \u201cthe subject of widespread speculation.\u201d Escobar had recently mounted a campaign for Congress, in which he spent freely in Medell\u00edn\u2019s poorer neighborhoods. He had initially tried to join a branch of Colombia\u2019s mainstream Liberal Party, led by a popular young politician named Luis Carlos Gal\u00e1n, but he was thwarted when Gal\u00e1n denounced him as a mafioso. Escobar, undaunted, joined a different branch of the Party, with the help of a powerful, corrupt senator named Alberto Santofimio. Escobar made it to Congress, and began working to build a political constituency in and around Medell\u00edn. \u201cHis civic vocation seems to know no limits,\u201d Semana gushed. \u201cHis civic works include entire neighborhoods, football fields, lighting systems, reforestation programs, donations of tractors, bulldozers, etc. At the moment he is moving forward with a program to build a thousand homes on a giant lot he owns. He bought it with the idea of building a neighborhood to relocate hundreds of poor families from the slums of Medell\u00edn, and he\u2019s already given jobs to some in his construction firm.\u201d For anyone looking, though, the real reasons for Escobar\u2019s interest in politics were clear. \u201cHis main political preoccupation right now is the extradition of Colombians,\u201d Semana said. \u201cFor him, this treaty, whereby Colombians who reside in their own country but who have issues in the United States can be handed over to the authorities of that country, constitutes \u2018a violation of national sovereignty.\u2019 \u201d His electoral ambitions did not go very far. He was soon denounced as a gangster by Colombia\u2019s justice minister, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. Escobar fought back, falsely accusing the minister of being in the pocket of narcos. But then an influential newspaper editor named Guillermo Cano dug up an old news story showing that Escobar had been arrested, seven years before, for the possession of thirty-nine pounds of cocaine. Escobar was ejected from Congress, and the F.B.I. began investigating him. He went underground, and a long hunt began. In March, 1984, Colombian and American agents raided the cartel\u2019s headquarters. Known as Tranquilandia, it was a huge complex that contained at least seven laboratories, various airstrips, and more than a billion dollars\u2019 worth of cocaine. A month later, Escobar had his revenge, when two of his men, riding a motorbike, ambushed Lara Bonilla\u2019s car in Bogot\u00e1, killing him instantly. Escobar spent seven years as a fugitive, but his concern was less the Colombian justice system than the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. To force the state to withdraw from its extradition treaty with the U.S., he and his partners offered bounties on judges and prosecutors, in warnings that were signed \u201cThe Extraditables.\u201d The cartel\u2019s sicarios killed thousands of people, including more than two hundred and fifty policemen in Medell\u00edn. In 1986, his men murdered Cano, and they machine-gunned his old political enemy Luis Carlos Gal\u00e1n at a Presidential-campaign appearance in 1989. Many civilians were also killed, including the hundred and seven passengers and crew of an Avianca plane that Escobar had ordered blown up, in 1989, because he believed\u2014wrongly, it turned out\u2014that another unco\u00f6perative politician was on board. To force the government to negotiate, he abducted prominent Colombians, many of them journalists, including the daughter of a former President. Escobar\u2019s guiding principle was plata o plomo, meaning silver or lead\u2014either you took his money or you got a bullet.\n\nAnother Netflix series, the sixty-part \u201cSurviving Escobar,\u201d is based on a memoir by Jhon Jairo (Popeye) Vel\u00e1squez, one of Escobar\u2019s top sicarios. Since completing a twenty-three-year prison sentence, in 2014, Popeye has taken advantage of Escobar\u2019s resurgent glamour. In addition to the Netflix series, he has a YouTube show, \u201cRepentant Popeye,\u201d in which he films himself telling stories from the old days, commenting on the news, insulting his enemies (\u201cdespicable rats!\u201d), and haranguing soccer managers who don\u2019t meet his expectations. Despite the show\u2019s name, Popeye doesn\u2019t seem very repentant. He frequently expresses admiration for Escobar, whom he calls El Patr\u00f3n, and cheerfully acknowledges his crimes; he admits to having murdered more than two hundred and fifty people, including several leading politicians, and to having helped orchestrate the killings of some three thousand more. For the many Colombians who are ashamed to be associated with Escobar\u2019s memory, Popeye\u2019s brazenness is infuriating. His fans love it. The YouTube show has some six hundred thousand subscribers, mostly young, right-wing men. I met Popeye at his apartment, on the top floor of a newly built red brick tower, in a gentrifying neighborhood of Medell\u00edn. A slim, youthful man in his mid-fifties, with short-cropped silver hair and a camera-ready smile, he wore jeans and a black T-shirt, and his neck and arms were tattooed. Both of his forearms bore the phrase \u201cEl General de la Mafia,\u201d surrounded by skeletons and death\u2019s heads. The apartment had the feeling of a studio set. In the living room, a large window looked out on an adjacent apartment tower, and a camera on a tripod was placed near it. On the walls, an oil painting showed two cocks fighting against a black backdrop; another depicted an army of sperm breaking into eggs. Between them hung a number of masks, of the kind used in sadomasochistic rituals, including a replica of the one that Hannibal Lecter wore in \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs.\u201d Popeye explained that he liked them because they reminded him of death, and \u201cdeath is part of life.\u201d The narcoturistas are coming to Colombia in part because the country is experiencing unusual stability, after decades of vicious fighting. In 2016, the government, led by President Juan Manuel Santos, signed a peace treaty with the Marxist guerrilla army known as the FARC, ending a half-century insurgency. Popeye wanted no part of it. \u201cThere\u2019ll never be peace here in Colombia,\u201d he said. In his view, Santos was \u201ca professional traitor,\u201d and the treaty threatened Colombia\u2019s integrity by allowing Communists to run for office. Popeye was not opposed to violence. He was happy to acknowledge that Escobar, trying to cultivate allies to fight against rival criminal groups, had helped form a string of brutal right-wing paramilitaries; he spoke warmly of the former President \u00c1lvaro Uribe V\u00e9lez, who has frequently been accused of aiding the paramilitaries\u2019 work. (In a declassified 1991 Defense Intelligence document, Uribe also was named as a collaborator of Escobar\u2019s. Uribe denies the accusations. However, his brother is on trial for leading a terror group, and numerous associates of his have been imprisoned for similar crimes.) \u201cWe need an ultra-right-wing government here to stop Colombia from succumbing to Communism,\u201d Popeye declared. He gestured toward the mountains ringing Medell\u00edn\u2014a stronghold of paramilitaries\u2014and said, \u201cThere are already fifteen thousand armed men in these mountains. The day the FARC takes power, we\u2019ll become two hundred thousand, and, if we include the cities, altogether we\u2019ll be five hundred thousand. It\u2019ll be financed by industrialists, and the combustible ingredient to all of this will be cocaine.\u201d He saw himself as a key player in this future war, calling himself \u201cthe most experienced Colombian\u201d in matters of violence. He had killed innocent people, he said, and cut victims into pieces, but had done so because his enemies had done that to his people, too. Anyway, in those days it had been his job. He had been fighting what he thought was a war against a corrupt state and its extradition treaty with the United States. How did he sleep at night? By getting in bed, pulling up the covers, and closing his eyes. He didn\u2019t have time, he said, to andar con maricadas\u2014to mess around with fairy shit. Popeye complained that he had done his time and had helped prosecutors with investigations, but still the authorities interfered with his efforts to make a living, through his books and films. On his YouTube show, he claims that the police frequently stop him to ask questions about being involved in the cocaine trade. \u201cLook around,\u201d he said. \u201cI live simply. My apartment is nothing fancy, and my car is ordinary.\u201d In December, 2016, he appeared in a video wielding a semi-automatic pistol and telling his followers, \u201cHello, warriors. I\u2019m here in the streets of my beloved Medell\u00edn. I found my beautiful 9-millimetre Pietro Beretta. We\u2019re testing it\u2014we\u2019re firing it. It\u2019s a doll, a beauty.\u201d Popeye complained that Medell\u00edn\u2019s mayor had made a fuss, despite the fact that it was a stunt gun. Popeye stood and retrieved the gun, and, holding it by the barrel, he handed it to me. It was heavy, and looked real. \u201cSee?\u201d he said. Understanding that he meant to demonstrate that the gun was fake, I pointed the pistol at his cockfight painting and pulled the trigger. The apartment exploded with the bang. Popeye looked startled, and went to the door and opened it. The hallway was empty. \u201cWhere are the neighbors?\u201d he said. \u201cNot a soul. I could be murdered here and nobody would come.\u201d I told him that I didn\u2019t entirely blame his neighbors. Popeye laughed. Before I left, Popeye took a moment to endorse his latest production: an Internet-only film called \u201cX Sicario Professional,\u201d about a man who is released from prison and has to return to his city and take out the mafia don. He autographed a DVD copy for me. Knowing that I planned to see the mayor, he dedicated another to him, and asked me to give it to him on his behalf.\n\nSince becoming mayor, in 2016, Federico Guti\u00e9rrez has waged a campaign to reject what he calls \u201cthe past\u201d\u2014the legacy of narcotrafficking and violence. At the peak of Escobar\u2019s rampage, Medell\u00edn was the murder capital of the world, with more than six thousand homicides in 1991. In the past two decades, it has transformed itself, with significant investments in public transport, including a cable car that links the hillside slums to the city center, and a revamped downtown, with a botanical garden, a concert area, and an interactive science museum for children. Many of the city\u2019s slums, called comunas, are still controlled by gangs, but security has improved; last year, there were five hundred and seventy-seven murders. For the Mayor, understandably, Popeye represents a public-relations problem. Guti\u00e9rrez met me at his office downtown. A slender man of forty-three, he wears his hair long, in the manner of a soccer player, and favors jeans and dress shirts with the top button loose. Politically, he is right of center. Guti\u00e9rrez grimaced when I told him I had met Popeye, and said, \u201cEverything we are doing today to fight against narcotrafficking is because of what they did in the eighties.\u201d He had grown up during the violence, and still marvelled at the turnaround. \u201cThis is no longer the city of Pablo Escobar,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez declared. \u201cThis is the city Pablo Escobar tried, but failed, to destroy.\u201d When I gave Guti\u00e9rrez his dedicated copy of \u201cX Sicario,\u201d he looked disgusted and handed it back to me, holding it with two fingers as if it were contagious. \u201cI can\u2019t accept this,\u201d he said. \u201cSeeing Popeye back on the street is an offense to society and to his victims. But these are the laws.\u201d Last March, the American rapper Wiz Khalifa, in Medell\u00edn for a concert, visited Escobar\u2019s grave; later, he posted on Instagram images of himself smoking a joint at the tomb, along with the message \u201cSmokin wit Pablo.\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez had gone on television to call the rapper a sinverguenza\u2014a shameless ruffian\u2014and to say that he should have brought flowers to Escobar\u2019s victims instead. Later, Wiz Khalifa posted an apology on Instagram, saying, \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to offend anyone with my personal activities. . . . Peace and love.\u201d Still, Guti\u00e9rrez could barely contain himself at the memory. \u201cWe have to stop the narcoculture,\u201d he said. \u201cWiz Khalifa thought he could come here and make an apologia for crime but found out that he couldn\u2019t.\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez told me that he and his team were fighting to reclaim Medell\u00edn\u2019s story. \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell your history yourself, others will tell it for you,\u201d he said. Soon he would be inaugurating a new exhibit at the city\u2019s Museum of Memory, \u201cto show the victims\u2019 side of the story,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to conceal the true history, but we don\u2019t want those who did so much harm to be able to show themselves off as heroes. The real heroes are their victims. We want to be a symbol of what happened\u2014a city that collapsed but got to its feet again.\u201d When I mentioned that I had been on Roberto Escobar\u2019s tour, Guti\u00e9rrez blanched, and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll also do a tour\u2014an official tour.\u201d The unofficial tours frequently stop at the Monaco Building, an eight-story brutalist apartment tower of reinforced concrete, in the affluent Poblado district, that Escobar built for his family. In 1988, his rivals in the Cali drug cartel placed a powerful car bomb outside the Monaco; Escobar\u2019s mother, wife, and children were inside the tower, and though they sustained no serious injuries, they fled and did not return. Guti\u00e9rrez said that he planned to demolish the building and create a park in its place. He\u2019d needed to win over the Medell\u00edn police, who had wanted to refurbish it as an intelligence headquarters. Guti\u00e9rrez told me that he was waiting for one last signature. When he got it, he said, he would invite me to watch the demolition.\n\nIn a gruesome scene from the first season of \u201cNarcos,\u201d Escobar murders two trafficking partners, whom he suspects of withholding money. He kills the first one by beating him to death with a pool cue; when he is finished, his face and clothing spattered with blood, his men beat the other one to death. The story on which the scene is based is hardly less gruesome. According to Popeye\u2019s testimony, the two victims, Fernando Galeano and Gerardo Moncada, were shot, cut into pieces, and incinerated in a fire pit. Both the imagined scene and the real killings took place in La Catedral, the prison where Escobar was held after striking a deal to turn himself in, in 1991. An unused drug-rehabilitation center that was renovated to house Escobar, La Catedral occupied a secluded spot on the forested edges of the Envigado plateau, with spectacular views of Medell\u00edn. In the deal, Escobar agreed to spend a few years there, in exchange for the government\u2019s commitment not to extradite him to the United States. The prison did little to restrain him; his sicarios served as guards, and he remained involved in the cocaine trade. The key intermediary for his surrender was Rafael Garc\u00eda Herreros, an octogenarian priest who had previously accepted Escobar\u2019s gift of a \u201cvery beautiful hacienda\u201d on behalf of his church, and had gone on television to insist that he had done nothing wrong. \u201cWhen one fulfills the will of God, there is no corruption,\u201d he said. The road to La Catedral is winding and steep, full of switchbacks and narrow bridges that hang over mountain streams. On the morning of my visit, clouds obscured the valley, and everything was damp. La Catedral, at the top, is now a charitable home for elderly people, run by a Benedictine abbot, Elkin Ramiro V\u00e9lez Garc\u00eda. On the exterior wall, a billboard-size photograph shows the place as it was in Escobar\u2019s day; a picture of him, wearing a Russian fur hat, bears the caption \u201cHe who does not know his history is condemned to repeat it.\u201d In the main plaza\u2014a parklike area with na\u00efve mosaic murals\u2014several dozen residents warmed themselves in the morning sun. Others drank coffee in a cheerful mess hall, adorned with mounted bull\u2019s heads and old Coca-Cola advertisements. The visible remnants of the prison were set back, at the edges of the forest. There was what remained of Escobar\u2019s bedroom\u2014a concrete pad, overgrown with jungle\u2014and two guard towers. A large brick structure, once a video arcade for Escobar\u2019s men, had been repurposed as an administration building. The plaza had once been a soccer field, where Escobar played with his men. Father Elkin, a clean-shaven man in his early fifties, wearing a black soutane and a large crucifix, waved me into his office next to the mess hall. He said that Escobar\u2014Pablo, as he called him\u2014had chosen the site for his prison because he knew it well: it was an area where he used to have people killed and their bodies disposed of. \u201cHe did many, many, many bad things here,\u201d Father Elkin said. \u201cBut he also did wonderful things.\u201d This was a tendentious view but not an uncommon one, especially in Escobar\u2019s early years. The Semana story had spoken of his \u201cdesire to be the country\u2019s number one benefactor.\u201d Old comrades told me that they were attracted by his professed commitment to building a \u201cMedell\u00edn without slums.\u201d Popeye insisted that Escobar \u201cwas really a socialist\u2014he just had a different kind of socialism in mind, where everyone would have his own little car, his own little house.\u201d He had paid for the construction of a neighborhood that became known as Barrio Pablo Escobar: five hundred houses and several soccer fields. After he was pushed out of Congress, though, his largesse became a more direct exchange of money for influence. His bribes went to police officers and judges, but also to residents of the comunas. Father Elkin recalled that once, on a soccer field in a nearby community called El Dorado, he\u2019d watched Escobar hand out money to the poor. \u201cHe did many things for those who were helped by no one else, and he did so always in the company of the Church. The priest would go to see Pablo and always leave with his briefcase full. Was this evil? We would have to define evil to decide that.\u201d He raised his voice, as if speaking from the pulpit: \u201cThe Church has also done bad, bad things in the name of God! It will be God who judges us.\u201d Father Elkin said that Popeye\u2014\u201ca very good friend of mine\u201d\u2014came frequently to La Catedral, bringing tourists and a crew of bodyguards. Most of the narcotours were \u201cpure silliness,\u201d he said. \u201cThe guides tell the tourists anything that comes into their heads. For instance, I made an outdoor oven to incinerate the diapers of the old folks. Then I found out the guides were telling their tourists that it was where Pablo burned people!\u201d He shook his head. \u201cPopeye, on the other hand, tells his tourists the truth. For example, he talks about the asado de los Moncada\u201d\u2014the Moncada barbecue. When Escobar\u2019s men burned the bodies of Moncada and Galeano, they arranged to have a barbecue the same evening, to disguise the smoke and the smell. The killings, it turned out, helped dislodge Escobar from his comfortable imprisonment. When the visitors did not return from La Catedral, rumors spread that Escobar had killed them. A few weeks later, in July, 1992, the government attempted to move Escobar to a more secure facility, and he escaped in the process. For more than a year, he was pursued by a coalition of his enemies: the D.E.A. and the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command; a Colombian police team called the Search Bloc; and a death squad of criminal rivals that called itself Los Pepes\u2014short for People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar. On December 2, 1993, police traced a phone call between Escobar and his son, Juan Pablo, to a safe house in the Los Pinos neighborhood of Medell\u00edn. Colombian special forces swooped in. Escobar was killed at the house, felled by three bullets as he stood on its red tiled roof. He was bearded and barefoot, in jeans; a photograph circulated of him lying face down, his belly spilling out of a blue polo shirt. The Colombian artist Fernando Botero, noted for his fleshy, whimsical portrayals of people and animals, reimagined the scene in a heroic oil painting. \u201cThe Death of Pablo Escobar\u201d shows him standing on the rooftop with gun in hand, while bullets whiz around him, like insects pestering a giant. It hangs in the Museo de Antioquia, in downtown Medell\u00edn. \u201cI\u2019ll go in and look at stuff, but I won\u2019t read any signage.\u201d It is an item of faith among Escobar\u2019s family members that he killed himself before the authorities could get to him. Father Elkin wasn\u2019t even convinced that Escobar had really died. \u201cIf you ask me whether Pablo is dead, I would say I don\u2019t believe he is,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was a sagacious, astute man.\u201d He waved his arms around, as if to suggest that Escobar could be anywhere, still in hiding. He said that Popeye had told him that there were still bodies buried around La Catedral, in graves dug on his orders. (Popeye denies this.) Some of the elderly residents believed that La Catedral was haunted, Father Elkin said. They had seen and heard things. \u201cGhosts?\u201d I asked. \u201cNot ghosts\u2014spirits,\u201d he clarified. They had appeared to him, too. Sometimes they tapped him on the shoulder.\n\nIn Medell\u00edn\u2019s Montesacro cemetery, I found a fresh bouquet of pastel-colored flowers in a vase next to Escobar\u2019s tomb. The family plot is situated in a prominent spot next to the chapel, and flanked by graceful cypresses. On a slab of black marble, gold script spelled out \u201cPablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria, December 1, 1949\u2013December 2, 1993.\u201d El Patr\u00f3n had turned forty-four the day before his death. His parents were buried alongside him, as was his bodyguard Lim\u00f3n, who was with him when he died. Two young men stood quietly in front of Escobar\u2019s tomb, occasionally murmuring in French. At last, one of them walked to a marble bench opposite the tomb and sat in a pose of reverent contemplation. I was reminded of a YouTube video of Popeye paying homage to Escobar after he got out of prison. He knelt in front of the tomb, his eyes closed, like a choirboy about to receive the Sacrament. Colombians have spent decades trying to reconcile the ecstatic remembrances of Escobar with the mayhem he produced. In 1993, the novelist Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez began grappling with his legacy in \u201cNews of a Kidnapping.\u201d The book told the stories of the Colombians Escobar had abducted, as he tried to force the government to disallow his extradition. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez described Escobar as a monstrous Pied Piper: \u201cAt the height of his splendor, people put up altars with his picture and lit candles to him in the slums of Medell\u00edn. It was believed he could perform miracles. No Colombian in history ever possessed or exercised a talent like his for shaping public opinion. And none had a greater power to corrupt. The most unsettling and dangerous aspect of his personality was his total inability to distinguish between good and evil.\u201d After Escobar\u2019s death, the journalist Alonso Salazar set out to write a biography that would deflate the legend. In 2001, after several years of interviews with Escobar\u2019s relatives, friends, and enemies, he published \u201cThe Pablo Parable.\u201d Where Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez had suggested that Escobar had subjected Colombia to a kind of national hypnosis, Salazar suggested that he had merely been a conduit for the country\u2019s bigotry and violent impulses. \u201cThe Escobar story calls into question Colombia\u2019s entire society\u2014its political and economic elites, and the armed forces\u2014as to the coherence of our state and our capacity to build a nation where it is possible for everyone to live dignified lives,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s also a questioning of the international community, especially the United States, for its deceit in maintaining a war, the so-called war against drugs, which has . . . created criminality and destruction of life and nature that is beyond any precedent.\u201d Salazar later entered politics, serving as mayor of Medell\u00edn from 2008 to 2011, and was involved in many of the city\u2019s recent reforms. One evening, I met him at his home to discuss Escobar\u2019s legacy. \u201cThere is a resurrection of Escobar,\u201d he lamented, and he wondered if he had been partly to blame. His book about Escobar had been adapted for a television series, \u201cEl Patr\u00f3n del Mal,\u201d which began airing in 2012 and attracted obsessive fans across Latin America. \u201cThe series is balanced,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shows the victims, too, and the generals who fought Escobar. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the public watched it for. They watched it to see Escobar.\u201d When Salazar signed over the rights, he felt confident that the producers would not glamorize Escobar. One of them, Camilo Cano, was the son of the murdered newspaper editor; the other, Juana Uribe, was the daughter of a former Escobar hostage and a niece of a murdered politician. Still, the portrait of Escobar was ambivalent, and some viewers were offended. At a panel discussion in 2013, Uribe recalled, \u201cA woman once asked me, \u2018Why did you portray Pablo Escobar as loving with his children?\u2019 And I told her, \u2018Because that\u2019s how psychopaths are: loving with their kids\u2014and murderers.\u2019 And we need to understand that, if we\u2019re going to stop falling in love with psychopaths.\u201d She insisted that she had not wanted to make Escobar a hero. \u201cEscobar kidnapped my mother, killed my uncle.\u201d But, she said, \u201ca person that was able to do what Escobar did has also a normal face. And people have to learn that that\u2019s the way people are, they have two sides.\u201d Uribe bemoaned the appeal of antiheroes: \u201cPeople love bandits, no matter what we do.\u201d (As if to confirm her point, Popeye told me about his youthful fascination with \u201cScarface,\u201d in which Al Pacino plays a Cuban immigrant who becomes a cocaine kingpin. \u201cThat was the life we wanted to live!\u201d he exclaimed.) But \u201cEl Patr\u00f3n del Mal\u201d made it clear that, in a profoundly unequal country, Escobar represented a form of economic mobility. \u201cWhen there are no regular paths to get out of where you are, the bandit is the one who makes it\u2014the one who can jump ahead,\u201d Uribe said. He also appealed to a perverse sense of patriotism. The oath of Los Extraditables\u2014\u201cBetter a tomb in Colombia than a cell in the United States\u201d\u2014resonated with Latin Americans sensitive about Yankee intervention. \u201cEl Patr\u00f3n del Mal\u201d joined a wave of narconovelas\u2014soap operas featuring drug traffickers\u2014that are notably less concerned with ethical implications. One of the first, \u201cWithout Tits, You Don\u2019t Get to Heaven,\u201d revolves around a young woman, Catalina, who tries to make her way out of poverty by becoming a prostitute for narcos, getting breast implants to make herself more desirable. Despite the hand-wringing of politicians and journalists, the shows have resonated with people who have little faith in the state. As the Fordham anthropologist O. Hugo Benavides has written, \u201cNarconovelas set up an alternative moral political structure in which the state, government, politicians, law enforcement, bureaucrats, and soldiers are seldom portrayed as the good guys. The heroes are always either Lone Ranger types or misunderstood (and sometimes conflicted) drug dealers.\u201d \u201cNarcos\u201d avoids questions of culpability by narrating everything from the American perspective: the protagonist is not Escobar but the D.E.A. agents pursuing him. During the first season, Omar Rinc\u00f3n, a professor of media studies at Bogot\u00e1\u2019s University of the Andes, wrote a scornful review. The show, he said, presented a discomfitingly American vision of Colombians, \u201csomething like what Trump thinks we are: the good ones are the gringos in the D.E.A. And the narcos are comic misfits and tasteless throwbacks.\u201d Even the accents weren\u2019t right, he complained. For Colombians, he said, it was impossible to identify with the narrative. \u201cThe story makes heroes of those that Latin Americans consider villains: the D.E.A. agents. Which, in addition to being silly, goes against reality. Gentlemen of Netflix: know that the villains are the ones in the D.E.A.\u201d Escobar\u2019s death ended the second season of \u201cNarcos,\u201d but the show has continued; the third season followed the Cali cartel, and the fourth has moved to Mexico, which is now even more afflicted by drug violence than Colombia is. In September, a location scout named Carlos Mu\u00f1oz Portal was found shot dead in his car outside Mexico City. It was unclear whether Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s murder was a coincidence or a drug cartel\u2019s warning not to film in its territory; in any case, Netflix announced its intention to proceed with the production. Roberto Escobar suggested a solution to the producers: hire hit men to provide security.\n\nOn the twentieth anniversary of Escobar\u2019s death, a group of mourners wearing white shirts gathered at his tomb. They were there to attend a \u201cforgiveness Mass\u201d arranged by his sister Luz Mar\u00eda. After Escobar\u2019s death, his wife and children immigrated to Argentina, but Luz Mar\u00eda stayed, and, in the coming years, she organized several Masses to reconcile the Escobars with victims and their families. This one was a success. She handed each of the mourners a symbolic seed\u2014to help them \u201clet forgiveness enter and grow in their hearts,\u201d she said. A teen-age girl left a note at Escobar\u2019s graveside: \u201cI was told you did good things and bad things, but it doesn\u2019t matter now. Rest in peace.\u201d One evening, I spoke to Luz Mar\u00eda, in the food court of a luxury mall (near, as it happens, a restaurant where Popeye once arranged to have his own girlfriend murdered, on Pablo\u2019s orders). She told me, \u201cI have a slogan I always try and tell the media: \u2018No to drugs, no to narcotrafficking, no to violence, and yes to forgiveness.\u201d In Colombia, which is nearly eighty per cent Catholic, the rhetoric of contrition can be potent. Father Elkin described Escobar as a profoundly devout man who was led astray by his ambitions. But when I asked Roberto Escobar whether he felt repentant for his crimes he said no. \u201cIt\u2019s not important to be repentant,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a believer.\u201d (After the letter bomb, he said, he\u2019d experienced a particularly convincing vision of Christ.) Luz Mar\u00eda told me that she still hoped Popeye would find his way. She had bumped into him after his release, offered him a blessing, and told him that God had given him a second chance. Father Elkin was more resigned about Popeye\u2019s prospects: \u201cHe comes to confess, and I take his confession. If he doesn\u2019t comply with his confession, that\u2019s his business.\u201d In 2009, Escobar\u2019s son, Juan Pablo, appeared in a documentary called \u201cSins of My Father,\u201d in which he contacted victims of his father and apologized on behalf of his family. He has also reckoned with his father\u2019s memory in two memoirs, \u201cPablo Escobar: My Father,\u201d from 2014, and the untranslated \u201cPablo Escobar in Flagrante: The Things My Father Never Told Me,\u201d which was released in 2016. Just before Christmas, I had lunch with him in Guadalajara, Mexico, where he was promoting his latest book. Juan Pablo, who was sixteen years old when Escobar was killed, is now forty-one, a brooding, heavyset man with an unmistakable resemblance to his father; the image on the jacket of \u201cIn Flagrante\u201d seamlessly melds their faces. He told me that he learned the truth about his family when he was seven, and Pablo Escobar told him bluntly, \u201cI\u2019m an outlaw.\u201d From then on, they had a morning ritual in which his father read the newspaper and pointed out murders that had been attributed to him. Juan Pablo recalled, \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018I didn\u2019t do that one,\u2019 and then, \u2018I did that one.\u2019 \u201d In Argentina, Juan Pablo worked as an architect, but in recent years he has made a second career of rehabilitating the family\u2019s reputation. His new book offers a twenty-eight-point list of what he calls falsehoods propagated by \u201cNarcos.\u201d (\u201cMy father did not personally kill the person who is called Colonel \u2018Carrillo\u2019 in the series.\u201d) Over lunch, Juan Pablo told me about his work as a speaker, in which Mexican officials hire him to warn youngsters about the dangers of a criminal life style. He also owns a clothing line, Escobar Henao, whose mission statement declares, \u201cOur garments are banners of peace.\u201d (One T-shirt includes the family name and the phrase \u201cEnough will never be enough.\u201d) Alonso Salazar, the journalist and politician, told me, \u201cHe\u2019s very clever, and clearly he\u2019s been pondering the opportunities offered by this resurrection. He\u2019s living off the image of the father but realizes that he needs to be critical.\u201d At the restaurant, Juan Pablo excused himself to speak briefly with a producer about a movie project. Before the family fled Colombia, Juan Pablo opened a phone book and selected a new name, Sebasti\u00e1n Marroqu\u00edn, which he maintained until 1999, when an Argentine police investigation into allegations of money-laundering revealed his identity. (He was held for six weeks, then released for lack of evidence.) When I asked which name he preferred, he shrugged and said it didn\u2019t matter. He would always be Pablo Escobar\u2019s son. \u201cI live with permanent suspicion\u2014I was born guilty,\u201d he complained. He noted bitterly that the United States government had refused him a visa for twenty-four years. \u201cI want to be recognized as an individual,\u201d he said. \u201cI know about everything my father did, and I will go to each and every one of the families of his victims to ask forgiveness. But I\u2019m not legally culpable. My personal slogan is \u2018I inherited a mountain of shit. So what am I supposed to do with it?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAlonso Salazar told me that Pablo Escobar\u2019s legacy had profoundly altered political and social life. \u201cNarcotrafficking came along and just overwhelmed everything,\u201d he said. \u201cEscobar d\u00e9buted the instruments of terror, and afterward everyone used them.\u201d \u201cI told him to do that.\u201d The Medell\u00edn cartel\u2019s ascent coincided with the collapse of Communism in Europe, which in turn helped end most of the socialist revolution in the hemisphere. After Escobar, the idea of rebellion based on ideology was largely supplanted by the remorseless pursuit of profit and power. In places along his supply chain\u2014including Mexico and in Central America\u2014the remnants of his operation have grown into insurgent gangs, and states have succumbed to corruption and internal conflict. Escobar\u2019s cartel died with him, but, despite a U.S.-assisted war on narcotrafficking that has cost thousands of lives and more than nine billion dollars, international consumption has spread enormously, and the drug economy remains strong; last year, the United Nations reported that Colombia was the world\u2019s largest producer of cocaine. Five of the world\u2019s most dangerous cities are in Latin America, with much of the violence linked to the drug trade. Father Elkin suggested that Escobar\u2019s greatest legacy was his story. \u201cThe country likes to say that it has forgotten Pablo Escobar, but it\u2019s not true,\u201d he told me. \u201cToday\u2019s youth still see narcotrafficking as a way to make quick money. Society doesn\u2019t change, really. And those with the greatest responsibility for this\u2014excuse me\u2014are those in the media, with their television series and their books.\u201d Omar Rinc\u00f3n, the media-studies professor, once wrote, \u201cWe live the culture of drug trafficking, in aesthetics, values, and references. We are a nation that took on the narco idea that anything goes if it will get you out of poverty: some tits, a weapon, corruption, trafficking coca, being a guerrilla or a paramilitary fighter, or being in government.\u201d He was careful to note that the narco aesthetic was not merely bad taste. It was a way of life \u201camong the dispossessed communities that look to modernity and have found in money the only way to exist in the world.\u201d For a generation of traffickers, Escobar left behind a model of success: build support among the disenfranchised by providing them with money and power they would not otherwise have; in return, they will be your loyalists, your spies, and your gunmen. For the middle class, use your wealth to corrupt policemen, generals, judges, and politicians. The criminals who emulate him are no less ruthless, but they have learned not to seek political power, or much recognition. The Oficina de Envigado\u2014the closest successor to the Medell\u00edn cartel\u2014was run, until recently, by Juan Carlos Mesa, alias Tom, a shadowy figure who almost never appeared in public. Colombian special forces pursued him for years, without success. Then, in early December, police raided Tom\u2019s fiftieth-birthday celebration. (They were tipped off to the party by informants, who noticed unusually generous purchases of twenty-one-year-old Chivas.) There were some fifteen guests at the party, and, to the authorities\u2019 surprise, Popeye was among them. Despite an unconvincing alibi\u2014he just happened to be in the area, handing out copies of his memoir, and had stumbled upon the party\u2014Popeye was released, for lack of evidence. Even so, the incident triggered calls for him to be returned to prison, including one from Colombia\u2019s President, Juan Manuel Santos. Popeye\u2019s response was characteristically defiant. He fired off a flurry of tweets, saying, \u201cIt isn\u2019t a crime to go to a party,\u201d and calling his opponents \u201cmiserable rats.\u201d In a subsequent tweet, he sent a warning: \u201cIf I have to go to prison, I\u2019ll go. Very soon I will again be attacking this damned government.\u201d", "title": "The Afterlife of Pablo Escobar"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2018/03/05/daily-202-democratic-committees-divided-over-playing-in-primaries-with-texas-as-ground-zero/5a9c381430fb047655a06a9d/", "content": "Jim Mathis places a campaign sign near a polling site in San Antonio. The Texas primaries are Tuesday. (Eric Gay/AP)\n\nWith Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve.\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: The first primaries of 2018 in Texas on Tuesday could set the tune for six months of Democratic infighting.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has been taking fire from the left since publishing opposition research on Laura Moser, a progressive candidate in a crowded Democratic primary field to take on Rep. John Culberson (R). The campaign arm for House Democrats concluded that Moser could not win the general election in a suburban Houston district that Hillary Clinton narrowly carried. Among other things, she wrote a piece for Washingtonian magazine in 2014 that said she\u2019d \u201csooner have my teeth pulled out without anesthesia\u201d than move to her grandparents\u2019 home in rural Texas.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez does not think the DCCC should have publicized that information. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d he told me and USA Today\u2019s Susan Page in an interview that aired Sunday for C-SPAN\u2019s \u201cNewsmakers\u201d series. \u201cWe\u2019re at our best as Democrats when we talk about the issues. \u2026 I don\u2019t believe we should be anointing candidates. The people in Texas are the people who should be making the choices in Texas.\u201d\n\nThe public split showcased the diverging priorities of the party committees. The DCCC is willing to play the role of bad cop because leaders think it\u2019s the only way to pick up the 24 seats needed to win the House majority. The DNC, which Perez has now led for a year, is trying to restore trust that was lost in the national party during the contentious 2016 nominating contest between Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cOne thing we\u2019ve learned at the DNC is that when you, in fact or in perception, are trying to put the thumb on the scale in a spirited primary, that can undermine public confidence in us,\u201d said Perez. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve been neutral.\u201d\n\nLaura Moser picks up campaign materials at a print shop in Houston. (Michael Stravato for the Washington Post)\n\nA constellation of liberal groups \u2014 from Justice Democrats and CREDO to the Sanders-aligned Our Revolution \u2014 launched online petitions last week telling DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n to \u201cstop attacking progressives.\u201d\n\nThe DCCC anticipated this blowback. The veteran operatives who work there could have easily placed each of the \u201coppo hits\u201d on Moser in the press with no fingerprints attached. The fact they didn\u2019t was as significant as the underlying content of the message. They were sending a signal about their willingness to wade into crowded primaries and gauging the reaction from the left as they plot strategy for looming primary fights.\n\nThese operatives expect that it will be imperative to intervene in California, where a jungle primary system means that the top two finishers in June will face each other in November, regardless of their party. If there are bunches of Democrats splitting the vote, that could allow two Republicans to make it to the runoff.\n\n\u201cAs we've indicated all cycle, the DCCC is keeping all options on the table to work with our allies and ensure that there's a competitive Democrat on the ballot for voters to elect in November,\u201d Meredith Kelly, the DCCC\u2019s communications director, said on Sunday.\n\nRepublicans are hopeful that record numbers of Democratic primary candidates will lead to squabbling and push the eventual nominees to the left in places like Texas\u2019s Seventh District. The Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC backed by Speaker Paul Ryan, has been looking for opportunities to sow division. On Friday, the group published internal polling that showed Moser gaining since the DCCC\u2019s attacks.\n\nDNC Chairman Tom Perez participates in a Daily 202 Live event last year. (Kristoffer Tripplaar for The Washington Post)\n\nTalking with Democrats over the weekend about the appropriateness of wading into primaries sparked a sense of deja vu because I had almost identical conversations with strategists at the Republican committees and outside groups when they were out of the White House. Republicans blew a lot of winnable races during the Obama years because unelectable candidates prevailed in primaries, from Christine O\u2019Donnell and Sharron Angle in 2010 to Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock in 2012. Allies of Mitch McConnell became more aggressive in 2014, and it helped him become majority leader. On the other hand, going after tea partyers earned the enmity of the base \u2014 and helped lead to disenchantment with the party establishment that allowed for the rise of Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nJust like his Republican counterparts used to, Perez argued that heated primaries make his party stronger. He noted that Ralph Northam won the Virginia governor\u2019s race last November despite facing a credible primary challenge from former congressman Tom Perriello on his left.\n\n\u201cEverybody who went to the polls felt like they had a fair shake, and their candidate had a fair shake,\u201d said Perez. \u201cIt has increased turnout and it has really put wind at our back going into general elections. \u2026 We have to be careful not to confuse unity with unanimity.\u201d (Watch the full half-hour interview here.)\n\nBecause the DNC is staying on the sidelines, the DCCC is becoming a sort of boogeyman on the left. A black Democratic candidate in Pennsylvania last week even accused the committee of trying to nudge him out of the race in favor of white candidates, which the party denied. (Dave Weigel has more on that.)\n\nSigns point to an early voting location in San Antonio. (Eric Gay/AP)\n\n-- Against the backdrop of this intraparty wrangling, there is growing evidence of especially strong Democratic enthusiasm:\n\nFor example, a record number of candidates are running for Congress this year. Paul Kane pulled the numbers for his Sunday column: \u201cBy Dec. 31, 2017, more than 2,100 people had taken at least the first step toward running for the House or Senate by filing the necessary paperwork, according to records kept by the Federal Election Commission. For context, that\u2019s almost twice as many candidates who launched congressional campaigns in 2015. It represents the most candidates at this stage of the election season since the FEC started keeping these records, in 1977. \u2026\n\n\u201cBy Dec. 31, some 1,133 candidates had filed to run as Democrats for House seats, easily the largest crop either party has ever assembled at that point of an election cycle. Even Republicans, with 689 declared candidates for the House in 2017, have their second-largest field ever, trailing only 2009. That massive crop of 745 candidates, the second-largest ever for any party, set the stage for the 2010 midterm wave that delivered Republicans the House majority.\u201d\n\nIn Texas alone, there are 111 House candidates. For the first time in 25 years, at least one Democrat is running in all 36 of the state\u2019s congressional district. In 2016, the party didn\u2019t even field a challenger against eight GOP incumbents. \u201cOn a state legislative level, Democrats have candidates in 132 of the 150 state House districts and in 14 of the 15 state Senate districts up for election this year,\u201d NPR\u2019s Jessica Taylor notes. \u201cThat includes four Senate districts where Democrats didn't field candidates in 2014 or 2012, and 20 new House districts where they didn't have candidates in either 2016, 2014 or 2012.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks largely to a huge surge in Democratic turnout, Texans in the 15 largest counties have smashed the record for early voting in a non-presidential year,\u201d Jonathan Tilove reports in today\u2019s Austin American-Statesman. \u201cWhile there is no necessary correlation between primary and general election turnout, more than twice as many people voted early in the Democratic primaries in 2018 as in 2014, while Republican early voting crept up by 15 percent \u2026 Early voting this year in the Democratic contests was so high in Travis County [which includes Austin] that it slightly exceeded participation in 2016, a presidential year.\u201d\n\nRep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) deplanes from Air Force One with President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama in 2013. (Josh Reynolds/AP)\n\n-- The primary season that begins tomorrow will not wrap up until September, when Massachusetts, Delaware, New Hampshire, New York and Rhode Island vote. (See the full calendar here.)\n\nPurity tests could become a problem during the long stretch between now and then. A story on the front page of today\u2019s New York Times notes that even Rep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) is facing a serious primary challenge from his left in Boston. \u201cMr. Capuano, who is serving his 20th year in Congress, is a down-the-line progressive \u2026 But he has stirred a challenge from Ayanna Pressley, the first black woman elected to the Boston City Council,\u201d Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin report. \u201cIn a district once held by John F. Kennedy and Tip O\u2019Neill, where college campuses abound and minority communities now make up most of the population, Ms. Pressley argues that voters should demand an activist lawmaker who is more than a \u2018reliable vote.\u2019 In an unusual show of deference to Ms. Pressley, two of the state\u2019s highest-profile Democrats, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Seth Moulton, said they would stay neutral rather than back their colleague in Congress. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III \u2026 is behind Mr. Capuano.\u201d\n\nThe 66-year-old incumbent has voted twice to impeach Trump, but he could still lose anyway. \u201cMy district is upset,\u201d Capuano said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like the Donald Trump agenda, and I\u2019ve been as vocal as I can be.\u201d\n\nFolks attend a Republican congressional candidate forum in New Braunfels, Tex. (Eric Gay/AP)\n\n-- But while Democrats face pressure to lurch left, Republicans feel like they must wholeheartedly embrace Trump to win a GOP primary in this environment. Mike DeBonis and Eva Ruth Moravec report on the crowded GOP primaries in Texas: \u201cOne candidate\u2019s campaign signs declare \u2018MAGA,\u2019 referencing Trump\u2019s mantra of \u2018Make America Great Again.\u2019 Another\u2019s is promising to \u2018drain the swamp\u2019 and plays up his ties to a key Trump political adviser. And another\u2019s promises to \u2018Make America Like Texas,\u2019 a slogan spelled out in the Trump campaign\u2019s signature font. \u2026 With some notable exceptions, candidates in one especially raucous Republican primary \u2014 the 18-person contest to fill the 21st District seat being vacated by Rep. Lamar Smith \u2014 have been wary of showing any daylight between their position and Trump\u2019s. \u2018I think if you\u2019re not with the president, you\u2019re not going to have a chance of winning this race,\u2019 said Jason Isaac, a state representative who is running for the seat.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n-- \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d took home Best Picture at an Oscars that was rife with political moments. Dan Zak and Monica Hesse report: \u201c\u2018I think that the greatest thing our art does, and our industry does, is erase the lines in the sand,\u2019 said the winning film\u2019s creator, Guillermo del Toro, whose victory for best director was the fourth time in the past five years that a Mexican filmmaker took home that prize. \u2018We should continue doing that, when the world tells us to make them deeper.\u2019 The industry confronted its own mistreatment of women, and defied the isolationist and nationalist tone set by President Trump, in between doling out golden statuettes \u2014 which went to a wide spectrum of films, including the horror film \u2018Get Out,\u2019 whose writer-director Jordan Peele became the first black filmmaker to win best original screenplay, and the World War II action film \u2018Dunkirk,\u2019 which scooped up three technical awards.\u201d\n\nThere were many references to the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements: \u201c[Best Actress winner Frances McDormand] asked all the female nominees in the audience to stand. \u2018Okay, look around everybody, look around ladies and gentlemen,\u2019 McDormand said to a cheering audience. \u2018Because we all have stories to tell and projects we need financed. Don\u2019t talk to us about it at the parties tonight; invite us into your office in a couple days.\u2019 Nearly two and a half hours into the ceremony, three women who\u2019ve accused Weinstein of sexual abuse took the stage: Salma Hayek Pinault, Ashley Judd and Annabella Sciorra.\u201d\n\nHere is the complete list of winners.\n\n-- Host Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s jokes nodded to Hollywood\u2019s sexual misconduct scandals, Trump and Fox News.

(Andreas Solaro/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n-- Siren from Rome: The populist contagion has infected Italy. \u201cItalian populists of all leanings took a hammer to their country\u2019s old political order in Sunday elections, crushing traditional centrist parties in favor of a kaleidoscope of alternatives on the left and right and upending their former system,\u201d Michael Birnbaum reports from Rome. \u201cThe vote plunged Europe\u2019s fourth-largest economy into an uncertainty unique even to a nation known for cycling through leaders at a rapid clip. The shattering of the political landscape ruled out most plausible alliances among parties. But voters did not offer a clear direction for the future as they struggle with a stagnating economy and an influx of migrants, even as more than half voted for anti-establishment parties.\n\n\u201cThe surging outsider Five Star Movement captured more voters than any other party, about 32 percent, according to projections based on initial vote counts, meaning it is likely to play a key role in any governing coalition. In an extraordinary result, it appeared to have won nearly as many votes as the mainstream center-left and center-right parties combined. Italy\u2019s complicated electoral system could lead to initial results shifting slightly, but politicians of all stripes were treating the first projections as an earthquake.\n\n\u201cThe election drew the attention of anti-establishment crusaders from around the world, who saw the roiling populist energy of the campaign as a harbinger for other European nations. \u2026 Stephen K. Bannon was among the people who traveled to Rome to see the final days of the campaign. Formerly fringe ideas, such as deporting 600,000 migrants who have come to Italy without proper papers in recent years, have entered the mainstream.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cThe contours of the new regime are still unclear, but an old one is certainly passing,\u201d Ishaan Tharoor writes in his WorldViews newsletter. \u201cIn the weeks ahead, Italy's populists and ultranationalists will have to reckon with the actual prospect of taking power.\u201d\n\nGET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b\n\nThe nor\u2019easter that pounded the East Coast over the past few days claimed eight lives.

Jon Tester (Mont.) and Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), seen here with President Trump last year, support rolling back Dodd-Frank. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nTHE DECONSTRUCTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE:\n\n-- \u201cThe Senate is preparing to scale back the sweeping banking regulations passed after the 2008 financial crisis, with more than a dozen Democrats ready to give Republicans the votes they need to weaken one of President Barack Obama\u2019s largest legislative achievements,\u201d Erica Werner and Damian Paletta report. \u201cCongress\u2019s appetite for pulling back bank regulations shows the renewed clout of the financial sector in Washington, not just in the GOP but also among Democrats. Eight years after nearly every Senate Democrat backed a sweeping set of new rules for financial firms large and small, the party is now split, with moderates, several of them facing tough midterm election contests, working with the opposing party.\n\n\u201cThe core of the new bill exempts about two dozen financial companies with assets between $50 billion and $250 billion from the highest levels of scrutiny by the Federal Reserve \u2026 Supporters argue that the legislation would bring much-needed relief to midsize and regional banks that were treated like their much larger counterparts under the 2010 legislation known as Dodd-Frank. Opponents say it would weaken the oversight needed to stave off the type of dangerous lending and investing that brought the U.S. economy to its knees. The Senate is slated to take an initial procedural vote this week to move the measure forward, and if it eventually becomes law [as expected], it would be the most substantial weakening of Dodd-Frank since it was passed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the 10th anniversary of an enormous financial crash, Congress should not be passing laws to roll back regulations on Wall Street banks,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). \u201cThe bill permits about 25 of the 40 largest banks in America to escape heightened scrutiny and to be regulated as if they were tiny little community banks that could have no impact on the economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), a Banking Committee member and one of the new bill\u2019s leading Democratic supporters, said banks in his largely rural state have been going out of business in part because of the regulations imposed by Dodd-Frank. \u2026 Financial firms upped their campaign contributions to key Senate Democrats over the last year, with [Heidi] Heitkamp, [Joe] Donnelly and Tester becoming the top three Senate recipients of donations from commercial banks so far in the 2018 campaign cycle \u2026 Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who represents Wall Street and is often motivated by the desire to protect his vulnerable red-state incumbents, opposes the bill, but he has taken a largely hands-off approach to the debate thus far.\u201d\n\nThe offices of a shuttered coal operation are abandoned in Hi Hat, Ky.

It crosses 13 state boundaries. In Washington math, that means 26 senators have a reason to care about it. (Twenty-three of those 26 senators voted to keep it alive, including 15 Republicans.) One of states served by the commission is Kentucky, which is home to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. In January Trump nominated one of McConnell\u2019s top staffers, Tim Thomas, to be the federal cochairman of the commission. This year, Trump didn\u2019t suggest eliminating the agency. It\u2019s off the kill list.\u201d\n\nTHE REST OF TRUMP'S AGENDA:\n\n-- \u201cTrump says American workers are hurt by immigration. But after ICE raided this Texas town, they never showed up,\u201d by Nick Miroff: \u201cIn deep-red Moore County, where Trump won 75 percent of the vote, the president\u2019s rhetoric on immigration has emboldened some of his supporters to freely vent their frustrations at the meatpacking plant they blame for bringing crime, drugs and civic decline. Their corner of northern Texas has been culturally and economically transformed, and they had never had an American president say the transformation was a bad thing. And yet, no one seemed to believe the Cactus plant would be filled anytime soon with American workers. People here were not even sure they were American jobs in the first place. At least not since the Vietnamese and Laotians showed up in the late 1970s, a few years after the plant opened.\u201d\n\n-- Administration officials sent mixed signals about the president\u2019s aluminum and steel tariffs on the Sunday shows. From Anne Gearan and Karoun Demirjian: \u201cWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro appeared to draw a firm line against case-by-case exemptions as he defended President Trump's sudden imposition of new trade premiums, which are likely to hit Canada and Europe hardest. \u2026 \u2018As soon as he starts exempting countries, he has to raise the tariff on everybody else,\u2019 the adviser said [on Fox News] when asked about Canada and the European Union. \u2026 In a separate interview on CNN, Navarro suggested Trump could indeed grant exceptions if doing so would serve U.S. interests. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that although he does not expect Trump to change his mind, he does not rule it out.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s constantly shifting policy positions have left congressional Republicans feeling directionless. John Wagner and Seung Min Kim report: \u201cThe legislative standoffs on guns and immigration have also underscored a larger reality about Trump\u2019s relationship with Capitol Hill: ... He has been unable to score a major legislative victory on any issue that was not already a leading priority of Republican lawmakers. \u2026 Trump\u2019s policy inconsistencies are sure to complicate and even stymie whatever legislative agenda he has this year, leaving a vacuum of policy details that lawmakers then attempt to fill.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson attends the Ministerial Meeting of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS in Kuwait City, Kuwait. (Noufal ibrahim/EPA-EFE)\n\nTHERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- The State Department has spent none of the $120 million it was allocated to combat election interference by foreign actors, reports the New York Times\u2019s Gardiner Harris. \u201cAs a result, not one of the 23 analysts working in the department\u2019s Global Engagement Center \u2014 which has been tasked with countering Moscow\u2019s disinformation campaign \u2014 speaks Russian, and a department hiring freeze has hindered efforts to recruit the computer experts needed to track the Russian efforts. \u2026 [T]he funding lag reflects a deep lack of confidence by Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson in his department\u2019s ability to execute its historically wide-ranging mission and spend its money wisely. Mr. Tillerson has voiced skepticism that the United States is even capable of doing anything to counter the Russian threat.\u201d\n\n-- The State Department\u2019s 2019 budget calls for slashing funds for the National Endowment for Democracy, reports Josh Rogin. \u201c[The budget would also] disassemble [NED\u2019s] relationships with its core institutes, including the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute. For the NED and those institutes, the proposal is an assault not only on their organizations but also on the pro-democracy mission they are dedicated to. \u2026 The proposal initially came out of the Office of Management and Budget, even though the State Department did not formally ask for it. A senior OMB official told me the administration supports the NED\u2019s mission but wants to consolidate the funding streams to improve oversight and accountability. But the White House didn\u2019t provide any evidence that the current model is inefficient.\u201d\n\n-- In a closed-door speech, Trump praised China for ditching presidential term limits. From Amanda Erickson: \u201c[While speaking to Republican donors at Mar-a-Lago] on Saturday, Trump joked about the term-limits move, saying Xi is now \u2018president for life. President for life. No, he's great. And, look, he was able to do that. I think it's great.\u2019 \u2018Maybe we'll have to give that a shot someday,\u2019 Trump went on.\u201d\n\n-- Obama\u2019s former chief of staff Denis McDonough blamed Mitch McConnell for watering down language about Russian election interference in a letter to states about protecting their voting systems. From Karoun Demirjian: \u201cMcDonough complained on NBC\u2019s [\u2018Meet the Press\u2019] that members of Congress have shown a \u2018stunning lack of urgency about this question,\u2019 and he put the blame mostly on Republican leaders in Congress. \u2018The lack of urgency that we saw from the Republican leadership in 2016, we continue to see to this day today,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s beyond time for Congress to work with the administration, to work with the states, to ensure that our electoral systems are ready to go. This is not a game.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Axios obtained a grand jury subpoena that special counsel Robert Mueller's team recently sent to a witness in its Russia probe. The subpoena requests all communications the witness sent or received regarding Carter Page, Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump, Hope Hicks, Keith Schiller, Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, Roger Stone and Steve Bannon from November 1, 2015 (five months after Trump announced his presidential bid) to the present.\n\nFLORIDA FALLOUT:\n\n-- The Florida Senate rejected a ban on assault-style weapons and advanced plans to arm teachers in proposals on school safety. The Miami Herald\u2019s Mary Ellen Klas, Steve Bousquet and Lawrence Mower report: \u201cThe Senate is expected to approve the measure Monday and send it to the House, where leaders there hope to approve it in time for it to reach the governor\u2019s desk before the session ends on March 9 ... The Senate rejected nearly four dozen Democratic amendments ... The four-part package focuses on mental health, firearms safety, school safety and communication and includes what [one Republican lawmaker] said was \u2018the most frequent request\u2019 \u2014 to raise the age for buying a rifle or shotgun from 18 to 21.\u201d\n\n-- Senators from both parties urged Trump to take a leading role in crafting gun-control legislation. From Karoun Demirjian: \u201c\u2018He can set his legacy: President Trump coming forth to something like this and putting his support behind will give Republicans enough cover to support this,\u2019 said Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.)[.] \u2026 But the senator cautioned against adding a provision to ban semiautomatic weapons, such as the AR-15, to that bill. \u2026 Manchin also endorsed a new effort from Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) that would let police or relatives of an individual who shows \u2018red flags\u2019 to petition the court to seize that person\u2019s firearms. \u2026 \u2018The president did a good job talking about \u2014 we should be able to do something to stop shootings like this,\u2019 Graham said.\u201d\n\n-- Senators facing tough reelections have been conspicuously silent in the gun debate. From the AP\u2019s Steve Peoples. \u201cThey often choose strategic silence rather than get crosswise with the National Rifle Association\u2019s die-hard supporters on the right or the growing movement of passionate gun control advocates on the left. The office of Nevada\u2019s senior senator, Republican Dean Heller, would not say why did he did not attend the White House meeting. Heller \u2026 has avoided the spotlight in the subsequent days as well, declining to address specifics about his positions on gun legislation. \u2026 North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, both Democrats running for reelection in states Trump won handily, have said nothing about gun violence from the Senate floor in recent days, but made statements honoring constituents who had recently passed away.\u201d\n\n-- A gun show in a conservative Chicago suburb banned sales of AR-15s. Mark Guarino reports: \u201cOrganizers halted an advertised raffle that would have awarded an AR-15 to the winner, and vendors were told they would not be allowed to sell the weapon at the monthly show. Frank Cesare \u2014 of the Pioneer Valley Sportsman\u2019s Association, which has hosted the show for more than 40 years \u2014 said the decision followed complaints the group received after the Parkland shooting and as gun-control advocates planned to protest. \u2026 Cesare said that the ban on AR-15s also would remain in place for April\u2019s show and that the club is \u2018waiting to see\u2019 what the mood is like before deciding on shows later in the year.\u201d\n\n-- Former Ohio attorney general Marc Dann (D) wrote an op-ed for the Cleveland Plain Dealer entitled, \u201cWhy I regret being in the pocket of the NRA:\u201d \u201cUnlike other special interests that exert influence by making campaign contributions, the gun groups spend the blood money they collect from gunmakers to misinform and then motivate voters who care about a single issue: the sanctity of the Second Amendment. \u2026 Anyone who thinks Social Security is the third rail of American politics has clearly never talked about firearms with an NRA member. While I didn't enter politics to be an advocate for the NRA, I quickly learned that unless I became one, I wouldn't be around to advocate for the issues I did care about. So I made a devil's bargain with myself: To stay in office, I adopted pro-gun positions that made me uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nThe president, accompanied by the first lady, waves to members of the media as they arrive Saturday at Andrews Air Force Base. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nWEST WING INTRIGUE:\n\n-- Trump has become increasingly isolated as the White House weathers a series of controversies. From Politico\u2019s Nancy Cook and Andrew Restuccia. \u201c[A]s president, he rarely comes into contact with regular people except in the structured setting of the White House or during tightly orchestrated events set up by staff[.] \u2026 It\u2019s another way that Trump has obliterated the norms of the presidency, according to interviews with more than 20 current and former White House officials, Trump friends and close advisers. Rather than trying to project an air of accessibility, Trump has unapologetically stuck to his insular White House life, avoiding and more or less eliminating the optics of the president appearing in public as a citizen. The approach keeps Trump in his comfort zone but makes it harder for him to do the work of being president[.]\u201d\n\n-- HUD Secretary Ben Carson reportedly considered quitting amid recent budget battles. The New York Times\u2019s Glenn Thrush reports: \u201c\u2018There are more complexities here than in brain surgery,\u2019 Mr. Carson said in an interview last week. \u2018Doing this job is going to be a very intricate process.\u2019 \u2026 While Mr. Trump treats him with respect, he views him as a beta \u2018winner,\u2019 not as a \u2018killer,\u2019 the alpha in his organizational taxonomy, according to several White House officials. That lack of influence was painfully apparent during the internal debate before the release of Mr. Trump\u2019s budget, which would help pay for increases in military and Homeland Security spending with steep cuts to HUD\u2019s Community Development Block Grant and core housing programs. \u2026 In private, \u2026 Mr. Carson has been profoundly frustrated, telling friends he would find it difficult to stay if deep cuts to two housing programs, focused on helping the elderly and the disabled, were enacted.\u201d\n\n-- As other high-profile Trump advisers have left exited, Kellyanne Conway has managed to hold on. The New York Times\u2019s Katie Rogers and Maggie Haberman write: \u201cIn a White House with the highest turnover rates in decades, she has survived by knowing when to step back from the spotlight, keeping the president\u2019s ear, focusing on a policy issue significant to the poor and working class, and maintaining an unflinching loyalty to President Trump even as she outmaneuvers rivals on the staff. The public criticism hasn\u2019t abated, but Ms. Conway\u2019s skin is thicker than it used to be. \u2026 [O]ne of her biggest strengths, those who know her say, is that she has always understood whom she works for. Loyalty to her clients always came easily, but this time, her client just happens to be in the Oval Office.\u201d\n\n-- A group of Trump superfans greet him as he crosses a bridge every time he visits Mar-a-Lago. Lori Rozsa reports: \u201cThey call themselves the Bridge Family. \u2026 They\u2019re connected by a fanaticism for the president \u2014 and by their willingness to show up whenever they hear that his motorcade will cross the Southern Boulevard Bridge. \u2026 On the other side of the street, about a dozen protesters waved signs reading \u2018Corruption\u2019 and \u2018Impeach.\u2019 But on the side the president could see, it was all fans \u2014 about 60 of them[.] \u2026 He\u2019s been known to stop the motorcade and jump out of his armored SUV to greet fans on the bridge. And last year, in March and December, he ordered his staff to bring some of the Bridge Family to Mar-a-Lago.\u201d\n\nDemonstrators hold a sit-in outside the White House during the People's Climate Movement in April. (Eric Thayer/Bloomberg News)\n\nMORE ON THE MIDTERMS:\n\n-- A recently founded PAC is helping scientists run for office. Ben Guarino and Laurie McGinley report: \u201cNamed for the first three digits of pi, 314 Action describes itself as the vanguard of \u2018the pro-science resistance.\u2019 The group\u2019s founder, Shaughnessy Naughton, said 7,000 people have responded to the group\u2019s call to run for office. The group has also assembled a network of about 400,000 donors eager to support candidates who back science-based policies. While a few scientist-candidates are running as independents, most are Democrats making their first foray into party politics. (More than 80 percent of scientists in a 2014 Pew survey identified as Democrats or Democrat-leaning.) 314 Action is working with 30 congressional candidates across the country and expects to formally endorse about half that number.\u201d\n\n-- The National Journal\u2019s Josh Kraushaar argues that, if Republicans lose the special election in Pennsylvania, it will be \u201can unmistakable verdict that the healthy economy and Trump tax cuts will be overshadowed by the administration\u2019s dysfunction and roiling suburban anger.\u201d \u201cEven a close loss in such a reliably conservative area would raise red flags that Democrats are on the verge of a major landslide in the November midterms. \u2026 Though the economy may play to the GOP\u2019s advantage, the culture wars have turned squarely in the Democratic Party\u2019s favor \u2014 and that\u2019s what matters in today\u2019s politics. \u2026 Republicans are eager to pin a disappointing result in this election on their candidate \u2014 state Rep. Rick Saccone\u2014but the reality is the race is being defined on Trump\u2019s terms.\u201d\n\n-- A new poll finds Virginia Republicans have not consolidated support around a candidate to oppose Sen. Tim Kaine. Jenna Portnoy reports: \u201cCorey Stewart, the self-styled mini-Trump who nearly won the gubernatorial nomination last year, has a slight lead, but 66 percent of voters are undecided, the [Wason Center for Public Policy] poll found. The primary is June 12. The other candidates are evangelical pastor E.W. Jackson; Bert Mizusawa, a retired major general in the U.S. Army Reserve and foreign policy adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign; two-term state Del. Nicholas J. \u2018Nick\u2019 Freitas (R-Culpeper); and political newcomer Ivan Raiklin. Stewart enters as the most well-known candidate with the support of 16 percent of potential GOP primary voters. Jackson has 7 percent, followed by Freitas with 6 percent.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nTrump defended his decision to launch a trade war on Sunday night:\n\nWe are on the losing side of almost all trade deals.

Multiple Rohingya escapees said they saw the bodies of women whose breasts had been sliced off. \u2026 The violence has also upended what was supposed to be an American success story \u2014 the much-f\u00eated opening to an increasingly democratic Myanmar, championed by a U.S. president, Barack Obama, eager to make friends of old enemies willing to change their behavior.

The Somalis told of abuse on the flight, saying they were shackled with chains on their wrists, waists, and legs for more than 40 hours; forced to urinate in bottles or on themselves; and that ICE officers beat and threatened some passengers.

Yet the absence of opposition should not be interpreted as a universal embrace of the mayor\u2019s leadership or her administration\u2019s performance, Democratic leaders and operatives say.\u201d\n\nVIDEOS OF THE DAY:\n\nThe American Action Network launched a $1 million ad buy to continue promoting the GOP tax law:\n\nThe Post fact-checked whether the FCC\u2019s net neutrality ruling will actually end the Internet as we know it:\n\nSNL parodied Trump\u2019s response to the Parkland shooting:\n\nTaraji P.

At first governments think they can contain it, but soon the relationship between men and women begins to shift rapidly. A global revolution follows in which women, now physically dominant, topple patriarchal institutions like dominoes.\n\nFive days before Alderman\u2019s book was published in the USA, the New York Times reported allegations of sexual harassment and assault against film producer Harvey Weinstein. Five days after it was published, the hashtag #MeToo went viral. And two months after that, Time magazine named \u201cthe silence breakers\u201d, women who spoke out about abuse, assault and rape, as its \u201cperson of the year\u201d. A global revolution has indeed begun - though where it is going nobody yet knows.\n\nFrom its origins in the US, the impact of the movement spread rapidly, with millions of women around the world sharing their own stories of rape, assault and harassment in the workplace. Most cases will never meet the public eye in the way the Weinstein scandal did, with its rota of famous faces coming forward day after day to deliver lurid and disturbing details of the director\u2019s alleged predatory behaviour. But a glance at local media reports reveals that almost every country in the world has had its own #MeToo moment: From Britain\u2019s Westminster scandal to \u201cAustralia\u2019s Weinstein\u201d Don Burke and journalist Shiori Ito\u2019s unprecedented public discussion about her alleged rapist in Japan.\n\nThe phrase \u201cMe Too\u201d was first used by activist Tarana Burke 10 years ago in a grassroots campaign to reach underprivileged girls dealing with sexual abuse. But it became an overnight phenomenon after actress Alyssa Milano encouraged victims of sexual abuse to tweet #MeToo as a way to show the world a \u201csense of the magnitude of the problem\u201d following the Weinstein scandal. By the time she woke up the next day, thousands had responded. Within weeks it was more than a million.\n\nAs a viral campaign, part of the success of #MeToo was to do with how deeply personal it felt. Within days our social media feeds were flooded with friends and family members adding their stories. \u201cOf course, me too,\u201d a friend added simply on Facebook, neatly summarising the depressing inevitability that she too had experienced sexual harassment. The women mostly exchanged familiar stories and knowing looks. Surprise was the domain of men: \u201cI knew it happened, but I had no idea it was this bad\u201d was a common sentiment.\n\nIn Spain it became #YoTambien, in France it became #BalanceTonPorc, roughly translated as \u201cexpose your pig\u201d; in Italy #quellavoltache (\u201cThat Time When\u201d). In Israel, a Hebrew phrase translated as \u201cUs Too\u201d.

It hit Lee Merschon on Oct. 10, two days after the North Bay fires began to spread.\n\nMerschon runs an event-planning company in Los Angeles. Sitting at home there, watching reports about the fires on TV, he didn\u2019t understand how bad they were. Then he started getting phone calls from friends in Northern California who camp with him at Burning Man, the annual counterculture gathering in the Nevada desert.\n\n\u201cLee, this is it,\u201d said Jeff Evans, whose home in Napa County was nearly destroyed in a fire years earlier. \u201cThis is what the containers are for.\u201d\n\nThe containers. Every August at Burning Man, 70,000 people convene on a sun-blasted patch of Nevada desert and build a temporary city. Merschon\u2019s piece of Burning Man is Camp Epic, a campsite he founded in 2012. While many Burners eat and sleep in RVs, the 150 inhabitants of Camp Epic live in six heavily modified metal shipping containers. Each is basically a small house: a rectangular prism 40 feet long, like a giant Tetris block, built by a Nevada company called Quick Space that manufactures storage trailers and mobile offices.\n\nThe containers hold up better than RVs in the harsh glare and wind of Burning Man, Merschon says. They have electrical systems, ventilation, beds, shelves, mini-fridges. They don\u2019t have windows, on purpose. \u201cAt Burning Man, you can have 50 mph winds in a sandstorm that looks like \u2018Mad Max,\u2019\u201d he says. But inside a container, \u201cIt seems like everything is normal.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why, even before the wildfires, he\u2019d wondered whether the containers could be called into service in a disaster zone, providing a basic place to live after a hurricane or earthquake.\n\nThen the October wildfires struck, and thousands of homes went up in flames.\n\nThis is what the containers are for.\n\nThe plan formed quickly in Merschon\u2019s mind: People need housing. We have these containers. They\u2019re sitting in storage in Reno. Let\u2019s send them to people who need housing. Let\u2019s send them to the city of Santa Rosa, the center of devastation.\n\nIt felt like a sensible, responsible thing to do. The containers were metal. They couldn\u2019t catch fire like wooden structures. And Quick Space had built them to comply with Nevada\u2019s residential housing code. What could be simpler?\n\n\u201cAt least, that\u2019s what we thought,\u201d Merschon says.\n\nOver the next four months, though, he and dozens of volunteers got a crash course in why it can be so hard to erect housing in California. Santa Rosa officials say that the group had unrealistic expectations. The volunteers say they were obstructed by delays and red tape.\n\n\u201cWe kind of went down a rabbit hole,\u201d says Carmen Mauk, one of the group\u2019s leaders. They couldn\u2019t simply give their gift, they discovered; they had to wait, and wait, and then alter it at great cost, and then wait some more.\n\nThe Burners moved fast. The same day he spoke to Jeff Evans in Napa, Merschon called another camper, Jen Martini, who lived in Santa Rosa. Her mother had lost her house, almost all of her belongings and the family cat in the Tubbs Fire. Martini said she\u2019d go to Reno and prepare the cubes for transport.\n\nMerschon also contacted Mauk, who would become the heart and soul of the project. Mauk, 47, is a former resident of Santa Rosa. The Tubbs Fire had turned the house she used to rent into rubble and ash.\n\nMauk has more than a decade of experience in disaster relief. She got started in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina, when she traveled to the Gulf Coast of Mississippi with about 100 other Burner volunteers. They beat federal relief workers there, and began doing debris removal, tearing down damaged houses. They thought of the work as a gift; at Burning Man, a cashless society, the entire economy runs on gifts.\n\nPhoto: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle The painted 53-foot trailer at Oasis Village, a proposed and...\n\nMauk then founded a nonprofit, Burners Without Borders. Its volunteers went to Peru after an earthquake and built school classrooms and composting toilets. They went to Haiti after its 2010 earthquake. They went to New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.\n\nNow, Mauk was going back to Santa Rosa.\n\nShe knew that people had been struggling to find housing there even before the fires \u2014 only 1 percent of the city\u2019s rental stock was vacant \u2014 and when she heard that almost 9,000 homes and other buildings had been destroyed, she wondered about the fate of working-class people who keep its economy humming: teachers, vineyard laborers, construction workers. How could the region recover if its workers couldn\u2019t find shelter?\n\nMauk and other Burners contacted affordable housing groups. All said that the situation was desperate. They had lists of clients begging for any kind of housing.\n\n\u201cThere were no housing options before,\u201d says Lorena Sotelo, who assists Sonoma County farm workers at California Human Development, a large nonprofit. \u201cNow it\u2019s even worse.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency had yet to arrive. Its first temporary trailers wouldn\u2019t be habitable until Nov. 13, and many in need of shelter would avoid them anyway, fearing deportation, say Sotelo and others who work with undocumented clients. (FEMA has reported low demand; as of January, only 189 of 3,200 people eligible to live in the trailers had asked to do so.)\n\nAcross the region, in parking lots and along the beaches, people were sleeping in cars, in the cold, with no bathrooms, no security. At the Free Store in Healdsburg, a kind of emergency supply depot for shell-shocked families, Ariel Kelley met a family with two young sons sleeping in the back of their truck. When she heard about the shipping-container project, Kelley was excited. Dubbed Oasis Village, it seemed like the fastest way possible to get at least some people into beds.\n\nThe project\u2019s goal was a modest one: provide 76 beds for 76 people for up to nine months. If it worked, it would help 76 people stay in the area who might otherwise have to leave.\n\nMauk and the Burners put out a call for funds and volunteers; 250 people offered manual labor, and $30,000 in donations flowed in. A businessman who owned a cannabis greenhouse in an industrial part of Santa Rosa offered a piece of land. The six shipping containers arrived on Oct. 26, along with a 53-foot trailer that Merschon and his campers had also adapted into a living space. The structures were arranged in a rectangle around a 100-by-50-foot courtyard.\n\nPhoto: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle Oasis Village, in an industrial area of Santa Rosa, never housed...\n\nOn Oct. 31, the Burners applied for a temporary use permit from the city of Santa Rosa. While waiting to hear back, a rotating crew of volunteers spruced up Oasis Village. They put new bedding on the twin and queen beds inside the containers, and added heaters.\n\nThey also set up one of the containers as a kitchen, with donated cookware, and brought in separate trailers with showers and bathrooms. To make the site feel more welcoming, they covered the dirt courtyard with compacted gravel and artificial turf, and erected a semipermanent, heated tent above it, to serve as a communal area.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t luxury living. Still, nonprofit agencies had clients who wanted to move in. The Free Store\u2019s Kelley also heads Corazon Healdsburg, a nonprofit that works to find families affordable housing. Fifteen families told her they were interested; it beat sleeping in their cars.\n\nFrom the Burners\u2019 point of view, Oasis Village was now ready. They weren\u2019t just proposing to build housing; they had built it. Seventy-six temporary units, complete and available. All it needed was the city\u2019s blessing, and people could begin moving in.\n\n\u201cWe here \u2014 any local jurisdiction \u2014 has one set of rules,\u201d says Jesse Oswald, permit intake manager for the Santa Rosa Planning and Economic Development Department. \u201cCalifornia Building Code, Title 24. This is how we build things.\u201d\n\nOswald had no objections to the concept of Oasis Village, he says. He thought it was a creative solution, \u201ca cool project.\u201d But it was his job to make sure Oasis Village met the state building code before he signed any permits. He and his staff had to abide by the code, which is there to ensure the health and safety of residents. And it doesn\u2019t distinguish between emergency temporary housing and any other type. Oasis Village, a cluster of shipping containers, would have to go through the same permit process as a new single-family home in Santa Rosa\u2019s Coffey Park neighborhood, which was destroyed during the fires.\n\nThe Burners didn\u2019t realize this until they started talking to city planners. According to all involved, these were friendly conversations. But the Burners soon found them frustrating. The planners appeared overwhelmed; it often took weeks to get answers to questions. When the answers came, they weren\u2019t what the Burners wanted to hear.\n\nTo obtain permits, the Burners would need to show that the containers met California residential code \u2014 a daunting challenge. The retrofittted containers had been built to Nevada residential code by a company that wasn\u2019t on California\u2019s list of approved providers. From Santa Rosa\u2019s perspective, the containers were black boxes, full of potential liability. Was the wiring safe? Was there unhealthy Chinese drywall on the inside? (There wasn\u2019t.)\n\n\u201cI have no way of knowing how it was even assembled,\u201d says Oswald. \u201cIf I sign on the dotted line, I have to say I\u2019m really comfortable with 70 people living in these things.\u201d\n\nMerschon saw things differently: \u201cEverybody was covering their butts because they didn\u2019t want to get sued later.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle Painted shipping containers at Oasis Village.\n\nIt dawned on the Burners that the city wouldn\u2019t sign off unless expensive alterations were made. The site, they were told, needed access for disabled people. An ADA-compliant shower would cost at least $4,000.\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019re going to have ADA compliance,\u201d Mauk said, \u201cbut not on the first frickin\u2019 day we open. \u2026 Hello, there\u2019s an emergency housing situation here!\u201d\n\nThen there was the issue of windows. The containers didn\u2019t have any. To meet the code, windows would have to be cut into the containers\u2019 doors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s $250 a door,\u201d Mauk says. \u201cThere\u2019s 15 doors. Everything becomes very expensive very quickly.\u201d\n\nOne day, chatting with one of the planners, Mauk started to get \u201ca little riled up\u201d over the windows. Why delay the project for the sake of windows, she asked, when people were out there sleeping in their cars?\n\nAccording to Mauk, the reply came: \u201cWell, cars have windows.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe saw the ridiculousness in it, too,\u201d Mauk says, looking back. \u201cHe was trying to help me understand.\u201d Yes, cars have windows, and they\u2019re built to a standard, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re allowed to come into California.\n\nBy that point, Merschon was done. Done with the city, done with the whole project. When friends asked about it, he changed the subject. He wondered, darkly, if Santa Rosa was putting up roadblocks to Oasis Village because it didn\u2019t care if poor people left the city.\n\nMauk felt differently. She thought the planners wanted the project to happen, but didn\u2019t have the power. \u201cWe were met warmly from the beginning,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that their hands are really tied, having to follow state laws.\u201d\n\nShe sent a letter to Gov. Jerry Brown and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, asking the state to make an emergency declaration \u201cthat will allow for expedited temporary housing.\u201d She received no response from either office.\n\n\u201cThe system is not working,\u201d Mauk says. \u201cNobody is listening.\u201d\n\nOthers were also frustrated. Adrian Chorley, the affordable housing director at California Human Development, visited Oasis Village in December. He was impressed, he says. \u201cAnd the thing is that Carmen has done this before. She has actually set up a project in Haiti \u2014 with none of the problems we had here.\u201d\n\nHe thought Oasis Village looked like an RV park. Maybe not a place for families with young children, but a \u201cperfectly acceptable\u201d place for single adults, perhaps, or for the construction workers pouring into Santa Rosa to rebuild people\u2019s homes but with no place to live themselves.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t believe that the city wouldn\u2019t sign off on the needed permits. \u201cI quite literally stood there and said, \u2018What, are you kidding? They\u2019ve provided housing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs January began, the Burners were out of money, and enthusiasm. They had spent $30,000 to merely transport the containers from Reno and prepare the site. Actually running the project would require another $80,000. They applied for a grant from a fire relief fund administered by the Redwood Credit Union, but the grant was turned down. The credit union said the problem was the project\u2019s lack of permits. Mauk says that in conversations with Redwood, permits were never discussed.\n\nThe Burners guessed that if they tried to find other funding, they might be able to house people by March, at best. The containers had to go back to Nevada by August. Too much time had been lost.\n\nSo, on a warm and sunny Saturday in early February, Oasis Village came down. Mauk and a dozen volunteers stripped the beds, gathered up the kitchenware, and donated the sheets and pots and pans to charity.\n\nIn the months since the fires, the housing crisis in Sonoma County has worsened. One of the largest contractors planning to rebuild homes in Coffey Park, DeNova, announced in January that it was pulling out, saying it was unable to find enough workers. Officials say that 30,000 housing units must be built in the next five years to meet demand.\n\nChorley says that\u2019s unrealistic. \u201cWe\u2019ll be lucky, quite honestly, if we can build 2,000 to 3,000 units in the next five years.\u201d\n\nKelley says it\u2019s \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d that the Burners never got to house people, and thinks government should have been more flexible. \u201cWhen you\u2019re faced with this kind of a disaster, you hope that people are able to think outside the box,\u201d she says. \u201cHealth and safety have to be paramount, but at the same time, there are creative solutions to every problem. You just need to have willing participants who recognize the urgency.\u201d\n\nNonprofit groups say they are hearing from some clients that they can\u2019t make it here. They\u2019re leaving the region. \u201cThey\u2019re going to Texas, Arizona, Las Vegas,\u201d Sotelo says. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything. You know how you feel when you know the need is there and you can\u2019t do anything? I don\u2019t know what to say anymore.\u201d\n\nThe Burners have left, too. They\u2019ll never do another project in California, they say.\n\n\u201cWe showed up,\u201d Merschon says. \u201cWe built a town. It was ready in two weeks. We said, here you go. And they wouldn\u2019t take it. We give them a gift \u2014 how could they not take it?\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m reminded,\u201d he says, \u201cthat the real world doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d", "title": "In wake of Wine Country fires, a burning desire to help goes up in smoke"}, {"url": "https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/OSullivan-Sandherr-Trump-immigration-hurricane-12704653.php", "content": "O'Sullivan, Sandherr : Trump immigration acts will hurt families, slow hurricane recovery\n\nPhoto: Jon Shapley, Staff Photographer A man holds a sign during a press conference at the Mickey Leland...\n\nWhile lawmakers are working to resolve the precarious legal limbo of \"Dreamers,\" the termination of the Temporary Protected Status program has received far less attention and could have equally devastating impacts on families and the economy.\n\nThe Temporary Protected Status Program is a humanitarian program that provides an opportunity for those who have fled natural disaster and conflicts in their home country. The men and women in this program, many who have now been in the United States for decades, are crucial to the construction industry.\n\nAn estimated 50,000 TPS holders work in the construction industry - literally building America.\n\nThrough a series of determinations, the Department of Homeland Security has begun terminating the status for TPS holders from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan.\n\nTranslator To read this article in one of Houston's most-spoken languages, click on the button below. Outlook\n\nOver the next 18 months, collectively, this will force more than 350,000 legal immigrants out of the United States who have built careers, started families, paid taxes including Social Security, and in most cases raised U.S. citizen children.\n\nWhile the word \"temporary\" may seem an adequate justification for terminating the program, the fact remains that the conditions in these countries continue to be extraordinarily difficult.\n\nIn El Salvador, for example, there are severe food, water and housing shortages, as well as extremely high rates of crime and gang activity.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has even issued a travel advisory to American travelers warning of the conditions in El Salvador.\n\nHaiti is still recovering from the 2010 earthquake, and a recent United Nations report found that 2.5 million Haitians are still in need of humanitarian aid.\n\nTerminating TPS will return hundreds of thousands of people to countries who cannot meet the needs of those already there.\n\nIt will be a double blow to these nations because many families rely on earnings sent from TPS workers in the United States.\n\nGiven the recent destruction by Hurricane Harvey and the devastating wildfires in California, our businesses and local economies now, more than ever, need the help of workers from these countries. Rebuilding and recovery in large parts of the United States will be adversely impacted by a failure to extend their status.\n\nThese workers play an important role in helping to fill a small part of the larger workforce shortage gaps in the construction industry, and their role is vital in those communities.\n\nEven before Harvey and other hurricanes hit, large numbers of contractors across the nation were reporting difficulty finding needed workers.\n\nThe construction industry is facing a workforce shortage making the role of legal foreign workers all the more important.\n\nEnding TPS designation would create the loss of tens of thousands of workers and would lead to construction delays for many large and small projects that rely on those workers, and the impact would ripple through the economies of the communities waiting for those projects to be completed.\n\nMany TPS recipients are skilled union workers, and their expertise and experience are needed, now, especially if Congress moves forward on the White House infrastructure proposals.\n\nThere is no time for delay. We call on Congress to prevent the uncertainty and economic damage that would result from the removal of the current TPS designation for these workers.\n\nCongress must work with the administration to avoid a lapse for TPS designations and provide more structure and certainty to those who benefit in the construction industry.\n\nTerry O'Sullivan is general president of LIUNA - the Laborers' International Union of North America - representing a half-million workers predominantly in the construction industry.

Her initial response, she freely acknowledges now, was one of ambivalence, but when you\u2019re the daughter of a Chicano farmworker and a Jewish labor organizer (from Queens, no less), there\u2019s a sort of Calvinist inevitability to these things: \u201dYou are who you are before you\u2019re born, player,\u201d as Jay-Z might say. So not only did she make the trip, but she was accompanied by the whole of her immediate family \u2014 mother, father, and sister \u2013 in a kind of social-justice family vacation.\n\nWhat beckoned the Anaya clan was, of course, Venezuela\u2019s Bolivarian Revolution, which was, by that time, in its ninth year. And indeed, Rita found the experience exhilarating, if not downright transformative. It wasn\u2019t just seeing the material impact of President Hugo Chavez\u2019s socialist policies up-close \u2013 the nationalization of the oil industry, the ambitious land reform program, a steep reduction in the percentage of Venezuelans living in poverty, the sharp spike in the nation\u2019s literacy rates or the health clinics that proliferated across the gorgeous Caribbean landscape like daffodils after a spring rain, each of which ran counter to global economic trends of that time.\n\nAll of those achievements were impressive, to be sure, but what really beguiled Rita was that in a corner of the New World that has for centuries been governed by the European settlers who own the country, the non-white workers who built it were beginning to demand their fair share with growing confidence. And in the process, they were not only improving their material reality, but raising their level of consciousness, and fulfilling Frantz Fanon\u2019s prophetic vision of a new, post-colonial (Wo)Man.\n\nA new media for a newly awakened people\n\nThe perfect manifestation of the Venezuelan people\u2019s newfound faith were the grassroots community media outlets that began to sprout in the years following the 1989 Caracazo, when state security forces and military personnel roamed the streets of the capital city of Caracas, shooting indiscriminately at demonstrators protesting the government\u2019s abrupt shift to neoliberal policies. The practice of pirating airwaves to broadcast the news from the barrios was done largely clandestinely for fear of reprisals from the state, until Chavez was first elected president in late 1998, and promptly deployed community assemblies throughout the country to rewrite the constitution.\n\nThe resulting 1999 constitution is one of the world\u2019s most progressive and enshrines, as a human right, access to education, healthcare, housing, employment, political participation, and even the media. According to the news agency Venezuelanalysis, Article 58 of the constitution specifically states, \u201cCommunication is free and plural and must adhere to the obligations and responsibilities under the law. Every person has the right to objective, true and impartial information, without censorship\u2026,\u201d and goes on to assert that all communication media, public and private, must contribute to the social development of citizens. It further guarantees public access to radio, television, libraries and other information networks.\n\nIn her 2007 junket and her subsequent trips to Venezuela as an intern for the human rights organization, School of the Americas Watch, Anaya found herself enthralled with citizens\u2019 media \u2014 its reimagining of the Fourth Estate as a kind of bulletin board for revolution, and of the journalist as a public servant, tasked with helping build a Beloved Community.\n\nWhen provincial officials announced plans to privatize the local water supply, the alternative press didn\u2019t just cover the subsequent protests; it helped organize them. Similarly, the citizens\u2019 press led the peaceful takeover of a bullfighting ring that was converted into an arts and cultural center, and weekly radio shows allow high school students to combine hip-hop and politics. TV cameramen take great pains to photograph their subjects from below rather than from above \u2014 as the former camera angle tends to empower people and make them appear almost larger than life, while the latter is, quite literally, condescending.\n\nSaid one indigenous woman whose program was broadcast weekly on community radio:\n\nOur children turn on the radio, and they hear their aunt, their friend\u2019s mother, their older sister and her friends. They hear stories from the mouths of those who know the community and what we need. And they hear our language. All of this makes the children proud and eager to participate, and it gives our own community some of the power we lost to the lies of the media stations.\u201d\n\nIt was almost as if the media collectives were riffing on the Marxist intellectual C.L.R. James\u2019 famous supposition and asserting that if every cook can govern, surely every housemaid or gardener can report the news.\n\nThis democratization of the press was largely emblematic of a new political relationship in Venezuela, in which the unwashed passed an average of 200 handwritten messages a day to the head-of-state \u2013 \u201cI need a bag of cement to fix my house,\u201d or \u201cI need a job as a teacher,\u201d or simply \u201cGod Bless You, Hugo\u201d \u2013 and Chavez reciprocated with the most extraordinary of gestures: he spoke back.\n\n\u201cWhen Chavez talks, it is like he is one of us,\u201d Pablo Rosales, 53, a black cab driver told me when I visited Caracas in 2004. After returning from a state visit abroad, for example, Chavez would appear on his weekly television broadcast \u2014 Halo, Presidente \u2014 using a map and pointer.\n\n\u201cHe will say this is where I was and it takes X number of hours to travel there by plane from Caracas,\u201d an advisor, Maximilien Arvelaiz, told me, continuing:\n\nFor the rich and the middle class, this is all quite boring because of course they know where Spain is on the map. They think it is stupid. But poor people love this. No one has ever taken the time to explain this to them. He is the first president I\u2019ve seen who talks to the poor and not just the high class. He includes us when he talks.\u201d\n\nGrassroots media helps rescue Chavez, Venezuela in 2002\n\nBut alternative media really began to blossom after throngs of protesters managed to reverse a 2002 coup attempt orchestrated by Venezuela\u2019s oligarchs. In the hours after Chavez was abducted at gunpoint from the presidential palace known as Miraflores, Venezuela\u2019s major broadcasters and newspapers reported that he had simply resigned, and abandoned his presidency for Cuba, where presumably, he would live in comfort as a guest of his close friend, Fidel Castro.\n\nBut, knowing that the country\u2019s media moguls were in league with the coup-plotters (indeed, four media channels had ties to Chavez\u2019s conservative opposition), the Afro-Caribbeans and mixed-race mestizos who lived in the slums and the countryside refused to buy it, and took to pirated radio frequencies to rally the grassroots. Within hours, the barrios of Caracas rose up in unison, and tens of thousands of Chavistas streamed into the streets to assert their displeasure, louder than the proverbial bomb.\n\nArmed mostly with pots-and-pans and white-hot indignation, the rainbow-colored phalanx marched on the military base where Chavez was held, Fuerte Tiuna \u2014 engaging well-armed soldiers who fired on them along the route \u2014 to arrive, finally, at their destination, and demand the release of their democratically-elected leader.\n\nOutnumbered, and outmaneuvered in the court of public opinion, the shocked oligarchs had no choice but to relent; Chavez was restored to power a mere 48 hours after he was ousted, and went on to rule the coastal country of 31 million people for another 11 years until his death from cancer in 2013.\n\nDespite his common touch and his sometimes coarse language, Chavez, who was himself of mestizo and African ancestry, was an avid reader and an intellectual whose political ideology was steeped in his interrogation of revolutionary texts. While he admired Bolivar tremendously for his emancipation of the continent\u2019s northern rim, he fully understood that the Great Liberator would never have managed to loosen Spain\u2019s colonial chokehold on the continent without adding 250 Haitian soldiers, a small fleet, 4,000 muskets, 15,000 pounds of gunpowder, money, food and a printing press from Haiti, which had waged the first successful slave revolt in the Western hemisphere.\n\nChavez saw, moreover, that while Bolivar had indeed honored his promise to the Haitians to abolish slavery in the liberated colonies, his Republic never formally recognized Haiti, and, in fact, excluded his benefactors from the inaugural meeting of the Americas\u2019 newly independent states in 1826, while inviting one U.S. President James Madison, who supported both imperialism and the peculiar institution of slavery.\n\nOnce he had been extricated from the clutches of his own country\u2019s plutocrats, the savvy Chavez realized that, like Bolivar, he was singularly indebted to the black and brown Venezuelans who mobilized on his behalf, and that an independent media was a predicate for insulating the revolution from the future attacks that were inevitable. In the months following the aborted coup, his government introduced a flurry of proclamations and legislation to \u201cdarken\u201d the state, including the Presidential Commission for the Prevention and Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in the Venezuelan Educational System \u2014 requiring, among other things, that public schools teach the contributions of Afro-Venezuelans.\n\nAfter the ravaging of Hurricane Katrina through the Gulf Coast in 2005, despite a strained political relationship with the United States government, Venezuela offered aid to the region through its Venezuelan Embassy in the form of mobile hospitals, medical workers, power plants, and food. (A humiliated President George W. Bush, however, wouldn\u2019t even entertain the offer).\n\nIn the aftermath of a catastrophic earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010, Venezuela forgave Haiti\u2019s over $395 million dollars in foreign debt, and pledged more financial support to the Caribbean nation than did either the United States or the European Union. In 2005 Venezuela began leading initiatives in Afro-descendant communities such as New Orleans and the South Bronx, providing discounted heating oil and free energy-saving light bulbs to low-income families during the winter months. Venezuela also provided grants to community-based organizations to build self-sustaining institutions, such as worker-owned cooperatives and holistic healthcare centers for women.\n\nWhen the actor Danny Glover visited in early 2004 and attended a ceremony to name an elementary school for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., televised news accounts showed Chavez pointing to his curly hair and broad nose and saying that he, like Glover, was of African heritage. Simultaneously, community media was exploding, from 13 licensed radio, television and print outlets in 2002 to 193 licensed outlets by 2007, and another 300 or so unlicensed enterprises, according to Henry Fernandes, one of the founders of Radio Crepuscular, a popular station in Caracas.\n\nThe birth of teleSUR\n\nIn 2005, Chavez announced Venezuela\u2019s high-profile collaboration with the leftist governments of Cuba, Argentina, and Uruguay (and later Bolivia and Ecuador) to launch the state-financed, independent network teleSUR, to counter the corporate media that monopolizes information across the Americas. The network\u2019s first director general, Uruguayan journalist Aram Aharonian, described teleSUR\u2019s objective as:\n\n. . . to see ourselves as we truly were. . . . We were presented through a colonial mentality as blond and tall and European, and some of us are, but we\u2019re also short, dark, Zambo, Indian. We needed to shake off our inferiority complex and tell our own stories.\u201d\n\nRita Anaya was working on her dissertation and teaching at a Nigerian university when she spotted an online ad calling for reporters and editors to work at teleSUR\u2019s new English-language website in early 2014. She fired off her application immediately, and was among the first group of hires when teleSUR English began publishing from Ecuador\u2019s capital city, Quito, in the spring of that year.\n\nThe top-down ethos of teleSUR English\n\nBut it became immediately apparent that teleSUR English couldn\u2019t be more different from the grassroots media she\u2019d observed in Venezuela. The citizen-journalists she saw at work on-the-ground in Venezuela were constantly out in the community, their reportage crackling with the energy, and chatter, of the streets. TeleSUR English is located in Quito\u2019s toniest neighborhood and resembles an insurance office. Its reporters seldom venture outside, conduct phone interviews, or even discuss news stories at length.\n\nThey are, for the most part, not reporters at all, but aggregators, rewriting news stories published elsewhere, and churning out a daily requirement of five stories, all of which are reproductions, typically absent any original reporting. While the editorial structure of Venezuela\u2019s community journalism was bottom-up, with reporters driving the coverage, top editors at teleSUR English exercised almost total control over coverage.\n\n\u201cWhat I saw in the community media was democratic, participatory and horizontal,\u201d Rita told MintPress, \u201cwhile teleSUR English was a top-down structure where we had to agree with the editorial line of the organization and we were never clear on where the line was. There was no transparency.\u201d\n\nAbout six weeks into the job, however, Rita pounced on an opening for the local correspondent\u2019s job in the Quito office, which would afford her an opportunity to engage with the community and generate her own stories. She beat out another writer for the job \u2014 a blonde, blue-eyed American \u2014 and started her new assignment in early July of 2014.\n\nBut from the start, no one seemed invested in her success. She received no training on how to edit video, nor did she receive any instructions on what kind of stories to pursue. It was difficult to find a cameraman to accompany her and, flying blind, she typically worked 12-hour days.\n\nAfter two weeks on the job, she was summoned to a video conference meeting with teleSUR\u2019s top editors. The organization\u2019s top editors in Caracas, and Quito \u2014 including Greg Wilpert, who is of German extraction and married to Venezuela\u2019s ambassador to Ecuador \u2014 were unhappy with her work. Her Spanish wasn\u2019t great, and she wasn\u2019t as productive as they hoped. As evidence of her shortcomings, they cited a segment she\u2019d reported on indigenous women organizing collectives and labor unions since the 2007 election of Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, whose liberal policies teleSUR supported.\n\nRead more by Jon Jeter\n\nWhat seemed particularly nettlesome was that she mentioned, even in passing, the patriarchal attitudes that were prevalent in Ecuadorian society. Rita exploded, noting that she\u2019d received practically no training, no instruction and very little support. \u201cGreg, whose side are you on?\u201d she asked, singling out Wilpert, who had hired her. \u201cYou\u2019re not a leader; you\u2019re a ball-less piece of shit.\u201d\n\nBut it was all to no avail. Management had already decided to replace Rita with the blue-eyed, blond-haired woman whom she\u2019d just beat out for the correspondents\u2019 job three weeks earlier. Rita returned to a desk rewrite job, and then, after a month in which she uttered not a single word to any of the top editors, quit and returned to the U.S. to finish her doctoral studies.\n\nFour years in, teleSUR English is, by any critical measure \u2014 the size of its audience, the impact of its journalism, or its strengthening of democracy \u2014 an abysmal failure, and represents nothing less than a betrayal of the Bolivarian revolution.\n\nThe cause of this failure is clear: central to Venezuela\u2019s socialist uprising are people of color and women who are, intent on finally slaying the white-settler colonial state that reduced them to guest workers in the country of their birth, while the editorial policies and reportage of teleSUR English have, since its birth, been decided unilaterally by a battery of white men from North America who seem intent on maintaining the status quo.\n\nThe dysfunction of teleSUR English\u2019s reverse meritocracy\n\nBy the time I arrived in Quito in the summer of 2016 to start working for teleSUR English, Wilpert had been replaced as the newsroom\u2019s top director by Pablo Vivanco, Chilean by birth but raised in Toronto; and his top deputy, Cyril Mychalejko, who is of Ukrainian descent but raised in Philadelphia. TeleSUR English, I quickly discovered, is an inverse meritocracy, where the two least qualified journalists in the newsroom were charged with managing some of the most talented, hungry, and committed young journalists I\u2019ve met in nearly 30 years in-and-around the media.\n\nIn interviews and conversations with more than a dozen staffers at teleSUR English, Pablo, Cyril, Greg Wilpert and most of the outlet\u2019s top editors are consistently described in the most disparaging terms, and indeed it is hard to imagine that the hiring of such inept and morale-killing managers was an accident. Were teleSUR\u2019s top newsroom managers hired to rewrite the history of the Bolivarian Revolution, to return the European settler to power, and to restore the white man\u2019s unquestioned authority?\n\n\u201cI call it white respectability politics,\u201d said a young black woman who worked at teleSUR. \u201cWhy else would you have white men who are anti-black and anti-woman in charge of telling the story of the New World?\u201d\n\nWithout access to the organization\u2019s top decision-makers, their motives can only be a matter of speculation. What\u2019s hard to refute, however, is that under Vivanco and Mychalejko\u2019s leadership, the newsroom was a hive of misogyny, racism and mediocrity.\n\nFor starters, neither had worked for any mainstream journalism outlet, but had instead spent much of their careers prior to teleSUR in the NGO world. Neither one ever demonstrated any profound understanding of journalism, nor did they seem even remotely interested in developing one.\n\nAt an editors\u2019 meeting to discuss what we could do about teleSUR English\u2019s plummeting numbers and dwindling audience, the social media editor deconstructed our readership and concluded that we had no foundational audience and were reliant almost solely on clickbait and other gimmicks.\n\nHer prescription echoed the broad newsroom consensus: we needed to produce more original and compelling content. Cyril was unconvinced, however, and turned to the young editor after her presentation to ask rather sharply: \u201cHow do we know our numbers aren\u2019t down because some of our writers aren\u2019t producing their five stories a day?\u201d\n\nPablo\u2019s delayed response was even more bewildering. A week later he addressed the presentation in an email, writing: \u201cHow do we even know that our audience wants original content?\u201d\n\nA primer in how to stunt, thwart, and drive away talented journalists\n\nIn my four months at teleSUR, I don\u2019t recall a single conversation with Pablo or Cyril about the quality of our reportage or writing. Their entire raison d\u2019etre was disciplining the writing staff, which was comprised mostly of hard-working and gifted women and people of color. Once, the staff\u2019s best writer, a young Canadian woman whose parents had fled Pakistan, reported for her Sunday morning shift nearly three hours late. I was the only editor working that morning, and because she was never late, typically skipped lunch, and brought boundless energy and enthusiasm to her job, the thought of writing her up never crossed my mind.\n\n\u201cJon,\u201d Cyril snarled hysterically in a meeting two days later, \u201cwhen they\u2019re late you have to get in their face!\u201d\n\n\u201cFor what?\u201d I shot back dismissively. \u201cYou want to lose your best writer over a one-off?\u201d\n\nWith Pablo\u2019s blessing, Cyril fetishized authority, no matter how illegitimate. He once came into work two hours early to run the morning huddle to crack down on one enthusiastic copy editor who would pitch three or sometimes four stories, instead of the two that Cyril demanded, in a power move that was openly mocked by nearly the entire morning shift. Another time, the normally morose Cyril was almost giddy as he wrote up two women writers who had reported to work a few minutes late because of a parade near the office.\n\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d one of them asked in bewilderment. \u201cWe were like six minutes late.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Cyril said, grinning awkwardly, \u201cbut you know the rules.\u201d\n\nPablo and Cyril\u2019s mismanagement had unmistakable racial and patriarchal overtones.\n\nThe young woman who worked as the social media editor told me that Cyril and another top male editor had reprimanded her with such demonstrative hostility that she felt physically threatened. Paid op-ed articles were disproportionately commissioned to white writers, and writers of color like Matt Sedillo complained that their payments were routinely delayed for weeks, when white writers they\u2019d befriended told them that they\u2019d already received payment for articles published around the same time.\n\nA young man of Mexican ancestry, who was the most fully-developed writer at teleSUR when I was there, was banished to the graveyard shift for no other reason than that he had complained about working six days a week. When teleSUR\u2019s Venezuelan correspondent examined the country\u2019s chronic food shortages, he did so by explaining how difficult it was for him, a white British expatriate, to find his favorite foods, rather than interviewing a Venezuelan family. A black woman from Washington, D.C., who had worked for teleSUR, told me that Pablo was dismissive of suggestions to aggressively cover the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014 until the story was too big to ignore.\n\n\u201cHe said that Michael Brown was just another police shooting,\u201d she recalled, \u201cand it would soon blow over.\u201d\n\nThe only writers spared Cyril and Pablo\u2019s micro-aggressions were a young Arab man named Mohammed \u2014 who was the only Muslim Uncle Tom I\u2019ve ever encountered and once publicly repeated the trope that Middle-Eastern men, including his own father, are more prone to commit violence against women than are other men \u2014 and a Canadian woman named Heather, who many of us had taken to calling \u201cCointelpro\u201d because she tipped off Cyril and Pablo when a fellow writer either was late or pitched three stories instead of two at the morning huddle.\n\nHeather was also the author of a profile of a blonde-haired Dutch woman who had joined the Marxist-influenced revolutionary militia known by its Spanish acronym, the FARC. The story was problematic for a couple of reasons.\n\nOnly weeks earlier, a young woman \u2013 who I thought was the most aggressive reporter on staff \u2013 had pitched a story about the organizing efforts of indigenous women working in Bolivia\u2019s male-dominated mining industry. At an editor\u2019s meeting one afternoon, Pablo had openly derided the story idea and the woman who\u2019d proposed it, on the grounds that it might portray Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president \u2014 Evo Morales, a socialist and friend of the late Chavez \u2014 in a negative light.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not journalism,\u201d I said to Pablo in the meeting. \u201cThat\u2019s cheerleading.\u201d\n\nBut both he and Cyril had championed Heather\u2019s profile of the Dutch guerilla fighter, going so far as to publish it as the lead story, and allow it to remain in that position on the website for nearly twenty-four hours, when most stories remained in the top spot for no more than a few hours.\n\nThe entire staff ridiculed the profile as Orientalist dross. \u201cThere are enough n!@#$% in the FARC to make a Tarzan movie,\u201d I said to my coworkers, paraphrasing an old joke told on the 70s television sitcom Sanford and Son, \u201cand they find the one white girl to write a story on.\u201d\n\nLast straw \u2014 over and out\n\nA week before the 2016 election, I discovered that the Content Management System (CMS) was once again on the fritz. It would not allow me to save my edits. This was a recurring problem and one that I had complained to both Cyril and Pablo about just five days earlier. The system went down at 9:21 a.m; I called tech services to report the problem at 9:37. When they told me it would be at least half an hour before the problem was fixed, I ran an errand to the bank.\n\nI returned to find an email from Cyril reprimanding me for failing to alert CMS to the problem. I responded in an email, cc\u2019ing Pablo:\n\nFuck you and your written warning, Cyril. I have been having problems with CMS since Thursday . . . both of you are well aware . . . and yet, those same problems have not only continued but gotten worse.\u201d\n\nPablo wrote back that I should \u201cstand down.\u201d I responded:\n\nWho is responsible for CMS not working, if not you two? It is wholly unprofessional to write someone up for something that is (a) your responsibility, and (b) I handled appropriately. In 30 years in newsrooms, that is something else that I have never seen occur. In my 4 months here, I have seen absolutely NO investment in producing quality journalism. But you and Pablo seem awfully invested in being the BOSS, except when something really needs to be done. Our numbers are falling through the fucking basement and the only idea that comes from you and Pablo is writing someone up. It strikes me that you and Pablo are heavily invested in holding everyone accountable. And yet, the only two people in the office who are not accountable are you two.\u201d\n\nFearing that I would do time in an Ecuadorian jail if I saw Cyril or Pablo, I quit an hour later, and walked off the job.\n\n\u00b9Rita Anaya is a pseudonym as the source asked not be identified.\n\nTop Photo | Workers set up for the inauguration of TeleSur in Caracas, Venezuela, Sunday, July 24, 2005.

It hit Lee Merschon on Oct. 10, two days after the North Bay fires began to spread.\n\nMerschon runs an event-planning company in Los Angeles. Sitting at home there, watching reports about the fires on TV, he didn\u2019t understand how bad they were. Then he started getting phone calls from friends in Northern California who camp with him at Burning Man, the annual counterculture gathering in the Nevada desert.\n\n\u201cLee, this is it,\u201d said Jeff Evans, whose home in Napa County was nearly destroyed in a fire years earlier. \u201cThis is what the containers are for.\u201d\n\nThe containers. Every August at Burning Man, 70,000 people convene on a sun-blasted patch of Nevada desert and build a temporary city. Merschon\u2019s piece of Burning Man is Camp Epic, a campsite he founded in 2012. While many Burners eat and sleep in RVs, the 150 inhabitants of Camp Epic live in six heavily modified metal shipping containers. Each is basically a small house: a rectangular prism 40 feet long, like a giant Tetris block, built by a Nevada company called Quick Space that manufactures storage trailers and mobile offices.\n\nThe containers hold up better than RVs in the harsh glare and wind of Burning Man, Merschon says. They have electrical systems, ventilation, beds, shelves, mini-fridges. They don\u2019t have windows, on purpose. \u201cAt Burning Man, you can have 50 mph winds in a sandstorm that looks like \u2018Mad Max,\u2019\u201d he says. But inside a container, \u201cIt seems like everything is normal.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why, even before the wildfires, he\u2019d wondered whether the containers could be called into service in a disaster zone, providing a basic place to live after a hurricane or earthquake.\n\nThen the October wildfires struck, and thousands of homes went up in flames.\n\nThis is what the containers are for.\n\nThe plan formed quickly in Merschon\u2019s mind: People need housing. We have these containers. They\u2019re sitting in storage in Reno. Let\u2019s send them to people who need housing. Let\u2019s send them to the city of Santa Rosa, the center of devastation.\n\nIt felt like a sensible, responsible thing to do. The containers were metal. They couldn\u2019t catch fire like wooden structures. And Quick Space had built them to comply with Nevada\u2019s residential housing code. What could be simpler?\n\n\u201cAt least, that\u2019s what we thought,\u201d Merschon says.\n\nOver the next four months, though, he and dozens of volunteers got a crash course in why it can be so hard to erect housing in California. Santa Rosa officials say that the group had unrealistic expectations. The volunteers say they were obstructed by delays and red tape.\n\n\u201cWe kind of went down a rabbit hole,\u201d says Carmen Mauk, one of the group\u2019s leaders. They couldn\u2019t simply give their gift, they discovered; they had to wait, and wait, and then alter it at great cost, and then wait some more.\n\nThe Burners moved fast. The same day he spoke to Jeff Evans in Napa, Merschon called another camper, Jen Martini, who lived in Santa Rosa. Her mother had lost her house, almost all of her belongings and the family cat in the Tubbs Fire. Martini said she\u2019d go to Reno and prepare the cubes for transport.\n\nMerschon also contacted Mauk, who would become the heart and soul of the project. Mauk, 47, is a former resident of Santa Rosa. The Tubbs Fire had turned the house she used to rent into rubble and ash.\n\nMauk has more than a decade of experience in disaster relief. She got started in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina, when she traveled to the Gulf Coast of Mississippi with about 100 other Burner volunteers. They beat federal relief workers there, and began doing debris removal, tearing down damaged houses. They thought of the work as a gift; at Burning Man, a cashless society, the entire economy runs on gifts.\n\nPhoto: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle The painted 53-foot trailer at Oasis Village, a proposed and...\n\nMauk then founded a nonprofit, Burners Without Borders. Its volunteers went to Peru after an earthquake and built school classrooms and composting toilets. They went to Haiti after its 2010 earthquake. They went to New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.\n\nNow, Mauk was going back to Santa Rosa.\n\nShe knew that people had been struggling to find housing there even before the fires \u2014 only 1 percent of the city\u2019s rental stock was vacant \u2014 and when she heard that almost 9,000 homes and other buildings had been destroyed, she wondered about the fate of working-class people who keep its economy humming: teachers, vineyard laborers, construction workers. How could the region recover if its workers couldn\u2019t find shelter?\n\nMauk and other Burners contacted affordable housing groups. All said that the situation was desperate. They had lists of clients begging for any kind of housing.\n\n\u201cThere were no housing options before,\u201d says Lorena Sotelo, who assists Sonoma County farm workers at California Human Development, a large nonprofit. \u201cNow it\u2019s even worse.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency had yet to arrive. Its first temporary trailers wouldn\u2019t be habitable until Nov. 13, and many in need of shelter would avoid them anyway, fearing deportation, say Sotelo and others who work with undocumented clients. (FEMA has reported low demand; as of January, only 189 of 3,200 people eligible to live in the trailers had asked to do so.)\n\nAcross the region, in parking lots and along the beaches, people were sleeping in cars, in the cold, with no bathrooms, no security. At the Free Store in Healdsburg, a kind of emergency supply depot for shell-shocked families, Ariel Kelley met a family with two young sons sleeping in the back of their truck. When she heard about the shipping-container project, Kelley was excited. Dubbed Oasis Village, it seemed like the fastest way possible to get at least some people into beds.\n\nThe project\u2019s goal was a modest one: provide 76 beds for 76 people for up to nine months. If it worked, it would help 76 people stay in the area who might otherwise have to leave.\n\nMauk and the Burners put out a call for funds and volunteers; 250 people offered manual labor, and $30,000 in donations flowed in. A businessman who owned a cannabis greenhouse in an industrial part of Santa Rosa offered a piece of land. The six shipping containers arrived on Oct. 26, along with a 53-foot trailer that Merschon and his campers had also adapted into a living space. The structures were arranged in a rectangle around a 100-by-50-foot courtyard.\n\nPhoto: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle Oasis Village, in an industrial area of Santa Rosa, never housed...\n\nOn Oct. 31, the Burners applied for a temporary use permit from the city of Santa Rosa. While waiting to hear back, a rotating crew of volunteers spruced up Oasis Village. They put new bedding on the twin and queen beds inside the containers, and added heaters.\n\nThey also set up one of the containers as a kitchen, with donated cookware, and brought in separate trailers with showers and bathrooms. To make the site feel more welcoming, they covered the dirt courtyard with compacted gravel and artificial turf, and erected a semipermanent, heated tent above it, to serve as a communal area.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t luxury living. Still, nonprofit agencies had clients who wanted to move in. The Free Store\u2019s Kelley also heads Corazon Healdsburg, a nonprofit that works to find families affordable housing. Fifteen families told her they were interested; it beat sleeping in their cars.\n\nFrom the Burners\u2019 point of view, Oasis Village was now ready. They weren\u2019t just proposing to build housing; they had built it. Seventy-six temporary units, complete and available. All it needed was the city\u2019s blessing, and people could begin moving in.\n\n\u201cWe here \u2014 any local jurisdiction \u2014 has one set of rules,\u201d says Jesse Oswald, permit intake manager for the Santa Rosa Planning and Economic Development Department. \u201cCalifornia Building Code, Title 24. This is how we build things.\u201d\n\nOswald had no objections to the concept of Oasis Village, he says. He thought it was a creative solution, \u201ca cool project.\u201d But it was his job to make sure Oasis Village met the state building code before he signed any permits. He and his staff had to abide by the code, which is there to ensure the health and safety of residents. And it doesn\u2019t distinguish between emergency temporary housing and any other type. Oasis Village, a cluster of shipping containers, would have to go through the same permit process as a new single-family home in Santa Rosa\u2019s Coffey Park neighborhood, which was destroyed during the fires.\n\nThe Burners didn\u2019t realize this until they started talking to city planners. According to all involved, these were friendly conversations. But the Burners soon found them frustrating. The planners appeared overwhelmed; it often took weeks to get answers to questions. When the answers came, they weren\u2019t what the Burners wanted to hear.\n\nTo obtain permits, the Burners would need to show that the containers met California residential code \u2014 a daunting challenge. The retrofittted containers had been built to Nevada residential code by a company that wasn\u2019t on California\u2019s list of approved providers. From Santa Rosa\u2019s perspective, the containers were black boxes, full of potential liability. Was the wiring safe? Was there unhealthy Chinese drywall on the inside? (There wasn\u2019t.)\n\n\u201cI have no way of knowing how it was even assembled,\u201d says Oswald. \u201cIf I sign on the dotted line, I have to say I\u2019m really comfortable with 70 people living in these things.\u201d\n\nMerschon saw things differently: \u201cEverybody was covering their butts because they didn\u2019t want to get sued later.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle Painted shipping containers at Oasis Village.\n\nIt dawned on the Burners that the city wouldn\u2019t sign off unless expensive alterations were made. The site, they were told, needed access for disabled people. An ADA-compliant shower would cost at least $4,000.\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019re going to have ADA compliance,\u201d Mauk said, \u201cbut not on the first frickin\u2019 day we open. \u2026 Hello, there\u2019s an emergency housing situation here!\u201d\n\nThen there was the issue of windows. The containers didn\u2019t have any. To meet the code, windows would have to be cut into the containers\u2019 doors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s $250 a door,\u201d Mauk says. \u201cThere\u2019s 15 doors. Everything becomes very expensive very quickly.\u201d\n\nOne day, chatting with one of the planners, Mauk started to get \u201ca little riled up\u201d over the windows. Why delay the project for the sake of windows, she asked, when people were out there sleeping in their cars?\n\nAccording to Mauk, the reply came: \u201cWell, cars have windows.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe saw the ridiculousness in it, too,\u201d Mauk says, looking back. \u201cHe was trying to help me understand.\u201d Yes, cars have windows, and they\u2019re built to a standard, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re allowed to come into California.\n\nBy that point, Merschon was done. Done with the city, done with the whole project. When friends asked about it, he changed the subject. He wondered, darkly, if Santa Rosa was putting up roadblocks to Oasis Village because it didn\u2019t care if poor people left the city.\n\nMauk felt differently. She thought the planners wanted the project to happen, but didn\u2019t have the power. \u201cWe were met warmly from the beginning,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that their hands are really tied, having to follow state laws.\u201d\n\nShe sent a letter to Gov. Jerry Brown and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, asking the state to make an emergency declaration \u201cthat will allow for expedited temporary housing.\u201d She received no response from either office.\n\n\u201cThe system is not working,\u201d Mauk says. \u201cNobody is listening.\u201d\n\nOthers were also frustrated. Adrian Chorley, the affordable housing director at California Human Development, visited Oasis Village in December. He was impressed, he says. \u201cAnd the thing is that Carmen has done this before. She has actually set up a project in Haiti \u2014 with none of the problems we had here.\u201d\n\nHe thought Oasis Village looked like an RV park. Maybe not a place for families with young children, but a \u201cperfectly acceptable\u201d place for single adults, perhaps, or for the construction workers pouring into Santa Rosa to rebuild people\u2019s homes but with no place to live themselves.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t believe that the city wouldn\u2019t sign off on the needed permits. \u201cI quite literally stood there and said, \u2018What, are you kidding? They\u2019ve provided housing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs January began, the Burners were out of money, and enthusiasm. They had spent $30,000 to merely transport the containers from Reno and prepare the site. Actually running the project would require another $80,000. They applied for a grant from a fire relief fund administered by the Redwood Credit Union, but the grant was turned down. The credit union said the problem was the project\u2019s lack of permits. Mauk says that in conversations with Redwood, permits were never discussed.\n\nThe Burners guessed that if they tried to find other funding, they might be able to house people by March, at best. The containers had to go back to Nevada by August. Too much time had been lost.\n\nSo, on a warm and sunny Saturday in early February, Oasis Village came down. Mauk and a dozen volunteers stripped the beds, gathered up the kitchenware, and donated the sheets and pots and pans to charity.\n\nIn the months since the fires, the housing crisis in Sonoma County has worsened. One of the largest contractors planning to rebuild homes in Coffey Park, DeNova, announced in January that it was pulling out, saying it was unable to find enough workers. Officials say that 30,000 housing units must be built in the next five years to meet demand.\n\nChorley says that\u2019s unrealistic. \u201cWe\u2019ll be lucky, quite honestly, if we can build 2,000 to 3,000 units in the next five years.\u201d\n\nKelley says it\u2019s \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d that the Burners never got to house people, and thinks government should have been more flexible. \u201cWhen you\u2019re faced with this kind of a disaster, you hope that people are able to think outside the box,\u201d she says. \u201cHealth and safety have to be paramount, but at the same time, there are creative solutions to every problem. You just need to have willing participants who recognize the urgency.\u201d\n\nNonprofit groups say they are hearing from some clients that they can\u2019t make it here. They\u2019re leaving the region. \u201cThey\u2019re going to Texas, Arizona, Las Vegas,\u201d Sotelo says. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything. You know how you feel when you know the need is there and you can\u2019t do anything? I don\u2019t know what to say anymore.\u201d\n\nThe Burners have left, too. They\u2019ll never do another project in California, they say.\n\n\u201cWe showed up,\u201d Merschon says. \u201cWe built a town. It was ready in two weeks. We said, here you go. And they wouldn\u2019t take it. We give them a gift \u2014 how could they not take it?\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m reminded,\u201d he says, \u201cthat the real world doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d", "title": "In wake of Wine Country fires, a burning desire to help goes up in smoke"}, {"url": "https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/OSullivan-Sandherr-Trump-immigration-hurricane-12704653.php", "content": "O'Sullivan, Sandherr : Trump immigration acts will hurt families, slow hurricane recovery\n\nPhoto: Jon Shapley, Staff Photographer A man holds a sign during a press conference at the Mickey Leland...\n\nWhile lawmakers are working to resolve the precarious legal limbo of \"Dreamers,\" the termination of the Temporary Protected Status program has received far less attention and could have equally devastating impacts on families and the economy.\n\nThe Temporary Protected Status Program is a humanitarian program that provides an opportunity for those who have fled natural disaster and conflicts in their home country.

Outlook\n\nOver the next 18 months, collectively, this will force more than 350,000 legal immigrants out of the United States who have built careers, started families, paid taxes including Social Security, and in most cases raised U.S. citizen children.\n\nWhile the word \"temporary\" may seem an adequate justification for terminating the program, the fact remains that the conditions in these countries continue to be extraordinarily difficult.\n\nIn El Salvador, for example, there are severe food, water and housing shortages, as well as extremely high rates of crime and gang activity.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has even issued a travel advisory to American travelers warning of the conditions in El Salvador.\n\nHaiti is still recovering from the 2010 earthquake, and a recent United Nations report found that 2.5 million Haitians are still in need of humanitarian aid.\n\nTerminating TPS will return hundreds of thousands of people to countries who cannot meet the needs of those already there.\n\nIt will be a double blow to these nations because many families rely on earnings sent from TPS workers in the United States.\n\nGiven the recent destruction by Hurricane Harvey and the devastating wildfires in California, our businesses and local economies now, more than ever, need the help of workers from these countries. Rebuilding and recovery in large parts of the United States will be adversely impacted by a failure to extend their status.\n\nThese workers play an important role in helping to fill a small part of the larger workforce shortage gaps in the construction industry, and their role is vital in those communities.\n\nEven before Harvey and other hurricanes hit, large numbers of contractors across the nation were reporting difficulty finding needed workers.\n\nThe construction industry is facing a workforce shortage making the role of legal foreign workers all the more important.\n\nEnding TPS designation would create the loss of tens of thousands of workers and would lead to construction delays for many large and small projects that rely on those workers, and the impact would ripple through the economies of the communities waiting for those projects to be completed.\n\nMany TPS recipients are skilled union workers, and their expertise and experience are needed, now, especially if Congress moves forward on the White House infrastructure proposals.\n\nThere is no time for delay. We call on Congress to prevent the uncertainty and economic damage that would result from the removal of the current TPS designation for these workers.\n\nCongress must work with the administration to avoid a lapse for TPS designations and provide more structure and certainty to those who benefit in the construction industry.\n\nTerry O'Sullivan is general president of LIUNA - the Laborers' International Union of North America - representing a half-million workers predominantly in the construction industry.

Her initial response, she freely acknowledges now, was one of ambivalence, but when you\u2019re the daughter of a Chicano farmworker and a Jewish labor organizer (from Queens, no less), there\u2019s a sort of Calvinist inevitability to these things: \u201dYou are who you are before you\u2019re born, player,\u201d as Jay-Z might say. So not only did she make the trip, but she was accompanied by the whole of her immediate family \u2014 mother, father, and sister \u2013 in a kind of social-justice family vacation.\n\nWhat beckoned the Anaya clan was, of course, Venezuela\u2019s Bolivarian Revolution, which was, by that time, in its ninth year. And indeed, Rita found the experience exhilarating, if not downright transformative. It wasn\u2019t just seeing the material impact of President Hugo Chavez\u2019s socialist policies up-close \u2013 the nationalization of the oil industry, the ambitious land reform program, a steep reduction in the percentage of Venezuelans living in poverty, the sharp spike in the nation\u2019s literacy rates or the health clinics that proliferated across the gorgeous Caribbean landscape like daffodils after a spring rain, each of which ran counter to global economic trends of that time.\n\nAll of those achievements were impressive, to be sure, but what really beguiled Rita was that in a corner of the New World that has for centuries been governed by the European settlers who own the country, the non-white workers who built it were beginning to demand their fair share with growing confidence. And in the process, they were not only improving their material reality, but raising their level of consciousness, and fulfilling Frantz Fanon\u2019s prophetic vision of a new, post-colonial (Wo)Man.\n\nA new media for a newly awakened people\n\nThe perfect manifestation of the Venezuelan people\u2019s newfound faith were the grassroots community media outlets that began to sprout in the years following the 1989 Caracazo, when state security forces and military personnel roamed the streets of the capital city of Caracas, shooting indiscriminately at demonstrators protesting the government\u2019s abrupt shift to neoliberal policies. The practice of pirating airwaves to broadcast the news from the barrios was done largely clandestinely for fear of reprisals from the state, until Chavez was first elected president in late 1998, and promptly deployed community assemblies throughout the country to rewrite the constitution.\n\nThe resulting 1999 constitution is one of the world\u2019s most progressive and enshrines, as a human right, access to education, healthcare, housing, employment, political participation, and even the media. According to the news agency Venezuelanalysis, Article 58 of the constitution specifically states, \u201cCommunication is free and plural and must adhere to the obligations and responsibilities under the law. Every person has the right to objective, true and impartial information, without censorship\u2026,\u201d and goes on to assert that all communication media, public and private, must contribute to the social development of citizens. It further guarantees public access to radio, television, libraries and other information networks.\n\nIn her 2007 junket and her subsequent trips to Venezuela as an intern for the human rights organization, School of the Americas Watch, Anaya found herself enthralled with citizens\u2019 media \u2014 its reimagining of the Fourth Estate as a kind of bulletin board for revolution, and of the journalist as a public servant, tasked with helping build a Beloved Community.\n\nWhen provincial officials announced plans to privatize the local water supply, the alternative press didn\u2019t just cover the subsequent protests; it helped organize them. Similarly, the citizens\u2019 press led the peaceful takeover of a bullfighting ring that was converted into an arts and cultural center, and weekly radio shows allow high school students to combine hip-hop and politics. TV cameramen take great pains to photograph their subjects from below rather than from above \u2014 as the former camera angle tends to empower people and make them appear almost larger than life, while the latter is, quite literally, condescending.\n\nSaid one indigenous woman whose program was broadcast weekly on community radio:\n\nOur children turn on the radio, and they hear their aunt, their friend\u2019s mother, their older sister and her friends. They hear stories from the mouths of those who know the community and what we need. And they hear our language. All of this makes the children proud and eager to participate, and it gives our own community some of the power we lost to the lies of the media stations.\u201d\n\nIt was almost as if the media collectives were riffing on the Marxist intellectual C.L.R. James\u2019 famous supposition and asserting that if every cook can govern, surely every housemaid or gardener can report the news.\n\nThis democratization of the press was largely emblematic of a new political relationship in Venezuela, in which the unwashed passed an average of 200 handwritten messages a day to the head-of-state \u2013 \u201cI need a bag of cement to fix my house,\u201d or \u201cI need a job as a teacher,\u201d or simply \u201cGod Bless You, Hugo\u201d \u2013 and Chavez reciprocated with the most extraordinary of gestures: he spoke back.\n\n\u201cWhen Chavez talks, it is like he is one of us,\u201d Pablo Rosales, 53, a black cab driver told me when I visited Caracas in 2004. After returning from a state visit abroad, for example, Chavez would appear on his weekly television broadcast \u2014 Halo, Presidente \u2014 using a map and pointer.\n\n\u201cHe will say this is where I was and it takes X number of hours to travel there by plane from Caracas,\u201d an advisor, Maximilien Arvelaiz, told me, continuing:\n\nFor the rich and the middle class, this is all quite boring because of course they know where Spain is on the map. They think it is stupid. But poor people love this. No one has ever taken the time to explain this to them. He is the first president I\u2019ve seen who talks to the poor and not just the high class. He includes us when he talks.\u201d\n\nGrassroots media helps rescue Chavez, Venezuela in 2002\n\nBut alternative media really began to blossom after throngs of protesters managed to reverse a 2002 coup attempt orchestrated by Venezuela\u2019s oligarchs. In the hours after Chavez was abducted at gunpoint from the presidential palace known as Miraflores, Venezuela\u2019s major broadcasters and newspapers reported that he had simply resigned, and abandoned his presidency for Cuba, where presumably, he would live in comfort as a guest of his close friend, Fidel Castro.\n\nBut, knowing that the country\u2019s media moguls were in league with the coup-plotters (indeed, four media channels had ties to Chavez\u2019s conservative opposition), the Afro-Caribbeans and mixed-race mestizos who lived in the slums and the countryside refused to buy it, and took to pirated radio frequencies to rally the grassroots. Within hours, the barrios of Caracas rose up in unison, and tens of thousands of Chavistas streamed into the streets to assert their displeasure, louder than the proverbial bomb.\n\nArmed mostly with pots-and-pans and white-hot indignation, the rainbow-colored phalanx marched on the military base where Chavez was held, Fuerte Tiuna \u2014 engaging well-armed soldiers who fired on them along the route \u2014 to arrive, finally, at their destination, and demand the release of their democratically-elected leader.\n\nOutnumbered, and outmaneuvered in the court of public opinion, the shocked oligarchs had no choice but to relent; Chavez was restored to power a mere 48 hours after he was ousted, and went on to rule the coastal country of 31 million people for another 11 years until his death from cancer in 2013.\n\nDespite his common touch and his sometimes coarse language, Chavez, who was himself of mestizo and African ancestry, was an avid reader and an intellectual whose political ideology was steeped in his interrogation of revolutionary texts. While he admired Bolivar tremendously for his emancipation of the continent\u2019s northern rim, he fully understood that the Great Liberator would never have managed to loosen Spain\u2019s colonial chokehold on the continent without adding 250 Haitian soldiers, a small fleet, 4,000 muskets, 15,000 pounds of gunpowder, money, food and a printing press from Haiti, which had waged the first successful slave revolt in the Western hemisphere.\n\nChavez saw, moreover, that while Bolivar had indeed honored his promise to the Haitians to abolish slavery in the liberated colonies, his Republic never formally recognized Haiti, and, in fact, excluded his benefactors from the inaugural meeting of the Americas\u2019 newly independent states in 1826, while inviting one U.S. President James Madison, who supported both imperialism and the peculiar institution of slavery.\n\nOnce he had been extricated from the clutches of his own country\u2019s plutocrats, the savvy Chavez realized that, like Bolivar, he was singularly indebted to the black and brown Venezuelans who mobilized on his behalf, and that an independent media was a predicate for insulating the revolution from the future attacks that were inevitable. In the months following the aborted coup, his government introduced a flurry of proclamations and legislation to \u201cdarken\u201d the state, including the Presidential Commission for the Prevention and Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in the Venezuelan Educational System \u2014 requiring, among other things, that public schools teach the contributions of Afro-Venezuelans.\n\nAfter the ravaging of Hurricane Katrina through the Gulf Coast in 2005, despite a strained political relationship with the United States government, Venezuela offered aid to the region through its Venezuelan Embassy in the form of mobile hospitals, medical workers, power plants, and food. (A humiliated President George W. Bush, however, wouldn\u2019t even entertain the offer).\n\nIn the aftermath of a catastrophic earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010, Venezuela forgave Haiti\u2019s over $395 million dollars in foreign debt, and pledged more financial support to the Caribbean nation than did either the United States or the European Union. In 2005 Venezuela began leading initiatives in Afro-descendant communities such as New Orleans and the South Bronx, providing discounted heating oil and free energy-saving light bulbs to low-income families during the winter months. Venezuela also provided grants to community-based organizations to build self-sustaining institutions, such as worker-owned cooperatives and holistic healthcare centers for women.\n\nWhen the actor Danny Glover visited in early 2004 and attended a ceremony to name an elementary school for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., televised news accounts showed Chavez pointing to his curly hair and broad nose and saying that he, like Glover, was of African heritage. Simultaneously, community media was exploding, from 13 licensed radio, television and print outlets in 2002 to 193 licensed outlets by 2007, and another 300 or so unlicensed enterprises, according to Henry Fernandes, one of the founders of Radio Crepuscular, a popular station in Caracas.\n\nThe birth of teleSUR\n\nIn 2005, Chavez announced Venezuela\u2019s high-profile collaboration with the leftist governments of Cuba, Argentina, and Uruguay (and later Bolivia and Ecuador) to launch the state-financed, independent network teleSUR, to counter the corporate media that monopolizes information across the Americas. The network\u2019s first director general, Uruguayan journalist Aram Aharonian, described teleSUR\u2019s objective as:\n\n. . . to see ourselves as we truly were. . . . We were presented through a colonial mentality as blond and tall and European, and some of us are, but we\u2019re also short, dark, Zambo, Indian. We needed to shake off our inferiority complex and tell our own stories.\u201d\n\nRita Anaya was working on her dissertation and teaching at a Nigerian university when she spotted an online ad calling for reporters and editors to work at teleSUR\u2019s new English-language website in early 2014. She fired off her application immediately, and was among the first group of hires when teleSUR English began publishing from Ecuador\u2019s capital city, Quito, in the spring of that year.\n\nThe top-down ethos of teleSUR English\n\nBut it became immediately apparent that teleSUR English couldn\u2019t be more different from the grassroots media she\u2019d observed in Venezuela. The citizen-journalists she saw at work on-the-ground in Venezuela were constantly out in the community, their reportage crackling with the energy, and chatter, of the streets. TeleSUR English is located in Quito\u2019s toniest neighborhood and resembles an insurance office. Its reporters seldom venture outside, conduct phone interviews, or even discuss news stories at length.\n\nThey are, for the most part, not reporters at all, but aggregators, rewriting news stories published elsewhere, and churning out a daily requirement of five stories, all of which are reproductions, typically absent any original reporting. While the editorial structure of Venezuela\u2019s community journalism was bottom-up, with reporters driving the coverage, top editors at teleSUR English exercised almost total control over coverage.\n\n\u201cWhat I saw in the community media was democratic, participatory and horizontal,\u201d Rita told MintPress, \u201cwhile teleSUR English was a top-down structure where we had to agree with the editorial line of the organization and we were never clear on where the line was. There was no transparency.\u201d\n\nAbout six weeks into the job, however, Rita pounced on an opening for the local correspondent\u2019s job in the Quito office, which would afford her an opportunity to engage with the community and generate her own stories. She beat out another writer for the job \u2014 a blonde, blue-eyed American \u2014 and started her new assignment in early July of 2014.\n\nBut from the start, no one seemed invested in her success. She received no training on how to edit video, nor did she receive any instructions on what kind of stories to pursue. It was difficult to find a cameraman to accompany her and, flying blind, she typically worked 12-hour days.\n\nAfter two weeks on the job, she was summoned to a video conference meeting with teleSUR\u2019s top editors. The organization\u2019s top editors in Caracas, and Quito \u2014 including Greg Wilpert, who is of German extraction and married to Venezuela\u2019s ambassador to Ecuador \u2014 were unhappy with her work. Her Spanish wasn\u2019t great, and she wasn\u2019t as productive as they hoped. As evidence of her shortcomings, they cited a segment she\u2019d reported on indigenous women organizing collectives and labor unions since the 2007 election of Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, whose liberal policies teleSUR supported.\n\nRead more by Jon Jeter\n\nWhat seemed particularly nettlesome was that she mentioned, even in passing, the patriarchal attitudes that were prevalent in Ecuadorian society. Rita exploded, noting that she\u2019d received practically no training, no instruction and very little support. \u201cGreg, whose side are you on?\u201d she asked, singling out Wilpert, who had hired her. \u201cYou\u2019re not a leader; you\u2019re a ball-less piece of shit.\u201d\n\nBut it was all to no avail. Management had already decided to replace Rita with the blue-eyed, blond-haired woman whom she\u2019d just beat out for the correspondents\u2019 job three weeks earlier. Rita returned to a desk rewrite job, and then, after a month in which she uttered not a single word to any of the top editors, quit and returned to the U.S. to finish her doctoral studies.\n\nFour years in, teleSUR English is, by any critical measure \u2014 the size of its audience, the impact of its journalism, or its strengthening of democracy \u2014 an abysmal failure, and represents nothing less than a betrayal of the Bolivarian revolution.\n\nThe cause of this failure is clear: central to Venezuela\u2019s socialist uprising are people of color and women who are, intent on finally slaying the white-settler colonial state that reduced them to guest workers in the country of their birth, while the editorial policies and reportage of teleSUR English have, since its birth, been decided unilaterally by a battery of white men from North America who seem intent on maintaining the status quo.\n\nThe dysfunction of teleSUR English\u2019s reverse meritocracy\n\nBy the time I arrived in Quito in the summer of 2016 to start working for teleSUR English, Wilpert had been replaced as the newsroom\u2019s top director by Pablo Vivanco, Chilean by birth but raised in Toronto; and his top deputy, Cyril Mychalejko, who is of Ukrainian descent but raised in Philadelphia. TeleSUR English, I quickly discovered, is an inverse meritocracy, where the two least qualified journalists in the newsroom were charged with managing some of the most talented, hungry, and committed young journalists I\u2019ve met in nearly 30 years in-and-around the media.\n\nIn interviews and conversations with more than a dozen staffers at teleSUR English, Pablo, Cyril, Greg Wilpert and most of the outlet\u2019s top editors are consistently described in the most disparaging terms, and indeed it is hard to imagine that the hiring of such inept and morale-killing managers was an accident. Were teleSUR\u2019s top newsroom managers hired to rewrite the history of the Bolivarian Revolution, to return the European settler to power, and to restore the white man\u2019s unquestioned authority?\n\n\u201cI call it white respectability politics,\u201d said a young black woman who worked at teleSUR. \u201cWhy else would you have white men who are anti-black and anti-woman in charge of telling the story of the New World?\u201d\n\nWithout access to the organization\u2019s top decision-makers, their motives can only be a matter of speculation. What\u2019s hard to refute, however, is that under Vivanco and Mychalejko\u2019s leadership, the newsroom was a hive of misogyny, racism and mediocrity.\n\nFor starters, neither had worked for any mainstream journalism outlet, but had instead spent much of their careers prior to teleSUR in the NGO world. Neither one ever demonstrated any profound understanding of journalism, nor did they seem even remotely interested in developing one.\n\nAt an editors\u2019 meeting to discuss what we could do about teleSUR English\u2019s plummeting numbers and dwindling audience, the social media editor deconstructed our readership and concluded that we had no foundational audience and were reliant almost solely on clickbait and other gimmicks.\n\nHer prescription echoed the broad newsroom consensus: we needed to produce more original and compelling content. Cyril was unconvinced, however, and turned to the young editor after her presentation to ask rather sharply: \u201cHow do we know our numbers aren\u2019t down because some of our writers aren\u2019t producing their five stories a day?\u201d\n\nPablo\u2019s delayed response was even more bewildering. A week later he addressed the presentation in an email, writing: \u201cHow do we even know that our audience wants original content?\u201d\n\nA primer in how to stunt, thwart, and drive away talented journalists\n\nIn my four months at teleSUR, I don\u2019t recall a single conversation with Pablo or Cyril about the quality of our reportage or writing. Their entire raison d\u2019etre was disciplining the writing staff, which was comprised mostly of hard-working and gifted women and people of color. Once, the staff\u2019s best writer, a young Canadian woman whose parents had fled Pakistan, reported for her Sunday morning shift nearly three hours late. I was the only editor working that morning, and because she was never late, typically skipped lunch, and brought boundless energy and enthusiasm to her job, the thought of writing her up never crossed my mind.\n\n\u201cJon,\u201d Cyril snarled hysterically in a meeting two days later, \u201cwhen they\u2019re late you have to get in their face!\u201d\n\n\u201cFor what?\u201d I shot back dismissively. \u201cYou want to lose your best writer over a one-off?\u201d\n\nWith Pablo\u2019s blessing, Cyril fetishized authority, no matter how illegitimate. He once came into work two hours early to run the morning huddle to crack down on one enthusiastic copy editor who would pitch three or sometimes four stories, instead of the two that Cyril demanded, in a power move that was openly mocked by nearly the entire morning shift. Another time, the normally morose Cyril was almost giddy as he wrote up two women writers who had reported to work a few minutes late because of a parade near the office.\n\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d one of them asked in bewilderment. \u201cWe were like six minutes late.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Cyril said, grinning awkwardly, \u201cbut you know the rules.\u201d\n\nPablo and Cyril\u2019s mismanagement had unmistakable racial and patriarchal overtones.\n\nThe young woman who worked as the social media editor told me that Cyril and another top male editor had reprimanded her with such demonstrative hostility that she felt physically threatened. Paid op-ed articles were disproportionately commissioned to white writers, and writers of color like Matt Sedillo complained that their payments were routinely delayed for weeks, when white writers they\u2019d befriended told them that they\u2019d already received payment for articles published around the same time.\n\nA young man of Mexican ancestry, who was the most fully-developed writer at teleSUR when I was there, was banished to the graveyard shift for no other reason than that he had complained about working six days a week. When teleSUR\u2019s Venezuelan correspondent examined the country\u2019s chronic food shortages, he did so by explaining how difficult it was for him, a white British expatriate, to find his favorite foods, rather than interviewing a Venezuelan family. A black woman from Washington, D.C., who had worked for teleSUR, told me that Pablo was dismissive of suggestions to aggressively cover the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014 until the story was too big to ignore.\n\n\u201cHe said that Michael Brown was just another police shooting,\u201d she recalled, \u201cand it would soon blow over.\u201d\n\nThe only writers spared Cyril and Pablo\u2019s micro-aggressions were a young Arab man named Mohammed \u2014 who was the only Muslim Uncle Tom I\u2019ve ever encountered and once publicly repeated the trope that Middle-Eastern men, including his own father, are more prone to commit violence against women than are other men \u2014 and a Canadian woman named Heather, who many of us had taken to calling \u201cCointelpro\u201d because she tipped off Cyril and Pablo when a fellow writer either was late or pitched three stories instead of two at the morning huddle.\n\nHeather was also the author of a profile of a blonde-haired Dutch woman who had joined the Marxist-influenced revolutionary militia known by its Spanish acronym, the FARC. The story was problematic for a couple of reasons.\n\nOnly weeks earlier, a young woman \u2013 who I thought was the most aggressive reporter on staff \u2013 had pitched a story about the organizing efforts of indigenous women working in Bolivia\u2019s male-dominated mining industry. At an editor\u2019s meeting one afternoon, Pablo had openly derided the story idea and the woman who\u2019d proposed it, on the grounds that it might portray Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president \u2014 Evo Morales, a socialist and friend of the late Chavez \u2014 in a negative light.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not journalism,\u201d I said to Pablo in the meeting. \u201cThat\u2019s cheerleading.\u201d\n\nBut both he and Cyril had championed Heather\u2019s profile of the Dutch guerilla fighter, going so far as to publish it as the lead story, and allow it to remain in that position on the website for nearly twenty-four hours, when most stories remained in the top spot for no more than a few hours.\n\nThe entire staff ridiculed the profile as Orientalist dross. \u201cThere are enough n!@#$% in the FARC to make a Tarzan movie,\u201d I said to my coworkers, paraphrasing an old joke told on the 70s television sitcom Sanford and Son, \u201cand they find the one white girl to write a story on.\u201d\n\nLast straw \u2014 over and out\n\nA week before the 2016 election, I discovered that the Content Management System (CMS) was once again on the fritz. It would not allow me to save my edits. This was a recurring problem and one that I had complained to both Cyril and Pablo about just five days earlier. The system went down at 9:21 a.m; I called tech services to report the problem at 9:37. When they told me it would be at least half an hour before the problem was fixed, I ran an errand to the bank.\n\nI returned to find an email from Cyril reprimanding me for failing to alert CMS to the problem. I responded in an email, cc\u2019ing Pablo:\n\nFuck you and your written warning, Cyril. I have been having problems with CMS since Thursday . . . both of you are well aware . . . and yet, those same problems have not only continued but gotten worse.\u201d\n\nPablo wrote back that I should \u201cstand down.\u201d I responded:\n\nWho is responsible for CMS not working, if not you two? It is wholly unprofessional to write someone up for something that is (a) your responsibility, and (b) I handled appropriately. In 30 years in newsrooms, that is something else that I have never seen occur. In my 4 months here, I have seen absolutely NO investment in producing quality journalism. But you and Pablo seem awfully invested in being the BOSS, except when something really needs to be done. Our numbers are falling through the fucking basement and the only idea that comes from you and Pablo is writing someone up. It strikes me that you and Pablo are heavily invested in holding everyone accountable. And yet, the only two people in the office who are not accountable are you two.\u201d\n\nFearing that I would do time in an Ecuadorian jail if I saw Cyril or Pablo, I quit an hour later, and walked off the job.\n\n\u00b9Rita Anaya is a pseudonym as the source asked not be identified.\n\nTop Photo | Workers set up for the inauguration of TeleSur in Caracas, Venezuela, Sunday, July 24, 2005.

She speaks Monday at the UW.\n\nFor three decades, seismologist Lucy Jones soothed the nerves of quake-rattled Californians with her calm explanations and common-sense preparedness tips. Her frequent media appearances, including some with her toddler cradled on her hip, earned her a level of celebrity unprecedented among earthquake scientists since Charles Richter lent his name to the first earthquake scale.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been called the Beyonc\u00e9 of earthquakes, the Meryl Streep of government service, a woman breaking barriers in a man\u2019s world,\u201d the Los Angeles Times wrote in 2016 when Jones retired from the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nNow director of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Society, the pioneering researcher and communicator\u2019s latest mission is helping cities boost their ability to bounce back from natural disasters by applying science in a way that makes a difference.\n\nLucy Jones: \u2018Life Safety in the City: When There is More to Life Than Not Being Crushed\u2019 4:30 p.m. Monday, Alder Hall Auditorium, 1315 N.E.

In a Q&A with The Seattle Times (edited for clarity and brevity), she discussed topics ranging from our dread of earthquakes to why modern building codes aren\u2019t as great as most people think, and how scientists have bungled explanations of earthquake risk.\n\nQuestion: California has the country\u2019s highest earthquake risk, but Washington is second. What\u2019s your message for us?\n\nAnswer: You in many ways have a more challenging problem because you have fewer everyday earthquakes to bring the issue to public attention.\n\nThe concept of normalization bias (which causes people to underestimate the likelihood of a disaster and its effects) is a very strong thing in the human psyche. We\u2019re clearly evolved to focus on more immediate threats and we need stories, we need emotional connections to understand why we need to take action.\n\nEarthquakes are very difficult to plan for because of those reasons, especially if you don\u2019t remember the last time you had one. In very quiet times, it\u2019s very hard to get people engaged.\n\nFor a policymaker to decide it\u2019s worthwhile spending money on this when you have competing claims of homelessness and other problems, you need an emotional reason to connect and relate to your constituents and scientists don\u2019t understand that.\n\nQ: What\u2019s wrong with the way scientists communicate earthquake risk?\n\nA: As scientists, we explicitly refuse to use stories. One of the favorite lines is: The plural of anecdote is not data.\n\nWhen we did the ShakeOut scenario in California, we worked to make it a story, we made a movie out of it, the public fact sheet was written as a narrative.\n\nWe did not focus on probability. Talking about the probability of an earthquake in some time frame focuses on the part of the problem we don\u2019t know the answer to. When you talk about the uncertainty, people can find a reason to think it won\u2019t happen.\n\nWhen I\u2019m asked about the probability of an earthquake, I say \u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent. Just give me enough time.\u201d\n\nQ: How can you overcome denial and fatalism? The prospect of a magnitude 9 Cascadia megaquake and tsunami seems so overwhelming many folks just shrug and say: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d\n\nA: I think that\u2019s one of the most dangerous things that happens.\n\nEarthquakes are random, you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s coming and that makes it much more frightening. When you have too much fear, you don\u2019t do anything. That\u2019s been a mistake in how we sometimes message. We think we\u2019ve got to scare people. But that doesn\u2019t get them to act. They just want to hide from it.\n\nThe Cascadia 9 sounds much worse than the 8 in California, but the reality is it doesn\u2019t mean the shaking is going to be stronger. Your fault is offshore, so nobody is sitting on top of the fault.\n\nIt\u2019s not going to be any worse than what happened in Japan in 2011, and 150 people died in that earthquake. You can build to withstand earthquakes, period.\n\nAbout 18,000 people died in the tsunami, but they have way more people living in the tsunami zone than Oregon and Washington. If the Japan tsunami had been anything like a normal tsunami \u2014 it was about three times bigger than anyone thought was possible \u2014 they really would have had very few deaths.\n\nBut you cannot get only 150 dead here and keep your unreinforced masonry buildings.\n\nQ: Seattle doesn\u2019t require seismic retrofits for old brick buildings, also called unreinforced masonry. Los Angeles did it 30 years ago, and now is requiring upgrades to old concrete and soft-story buildings with weak ground floors. What does it take to get political action on seismic safety?\n\nA: The tradition is that it takes killing a lot of people. Most California laws were created because an earthquake killed people and that created the impetus. What\u2019s been so impressive about what\u2019s happening in Southern California now is the willingness to pass legislation without killing people first.\n\nA very large part of that is political leadership from (Los Angeles) Mayor (Eric) Garcetti. He recognized that we have a huge problem of affordable housing, and when the earthquake happens we\u2019re going to lose a huge amount of those older apartment buildings. Unless we want to make the problem 10 times worse, we have to prevent those apartments from being destroyed.\n\nWe also held lots of meetings with lots of stakeholders and laid out the consequences if we do nothing.\n\nThe arguments that brought people along were mainly economic, not lifesaving.\n\nQ: A lot of earthquake planning focuses on emergency response and personal preparedness. Why isn\u2019t that enough?\n\nA: Because that accepts damage is inevitable. When people ask me about earthquake prediction, I say: Do you want two hours to get out of a building, or do you want a building that doesn\u2019t fall down in the first place?\n\nWhy figure out how to survive not having water instead of fixing your water pipes so they don\u2019t break?\n\nIn L.A., we came up with a high-priority list, and the process is continuing.\n\nWe mandated that building owners had to pay for retrofitting their buildings, but the city is going to take on fixing the water system.\n\nAt the time, the only company in the world making seismically resilient pipes was in Japan. The city of L.A. went to American manufacturers and said: \u201cWe are only buying resilient pipe,\u201d and now there are cost-effective options out there.\n\nQ: Seattle is in the midst of a building boom. Won\u2019t all those new high-rises be fine after an earthquake?\n\nA: No. The current building code is a life-safety code. The goal is to not kill people. If you chose to have a building that\u2019s a total financial loss after the earthquake, that\u2019s your choice to make.\n\nI have a problem with that. The reality of an earthquake is that the failure of a building impacts the whole community.\n\nLook at what happened in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2011. No new buildings collapsed, but they had to tear down 1,800 buildings and they lost their downtown.\n\nI\u2019ve been working with state assemblymen to move California\u2019s building code up to a function recovery standard, so buildings could be repaired in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nWho knows if it will happen?

As a result the market is embracing new ways of working.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s 330 natural disasters are estimated to have caused a global economic loss of $353bn (\u00a3251bn), with Harvey, Irma and Maria accounting for 60% of the insured losses.\n\nInga Beale, the Lloyd\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe market experienced an exceptionally difficult year in 2017, driven by challenging market conditions and a significant impact from natural catastrophes. These factors mean that for the first time in six years Lloyd\u2019s is reporting a loss.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe world\u2019s oldest insurance market made a pretax loss of \u00a32bn last year, compared with a \u00a32.1bn profit the previous year. The group\u2019s combined ratio \u2013 a measure of claims and costs as a proportion of premiums \u2013 worsened from 98% to 114%. A figure above 100% indicates a loss.\n\nIts annual report showed Beale was paid \u00a31.3m last year, down from \u00a31.5m in 2016. Along with other executives, she did not receive a bonus payout under the Lloyd\u2019s performance plan last year because the LPP only pays out if the company makes an annual profit of more than \u00a3100m.\n\nLloyd\u2019s was one of the first UK businesses to publish its gender pay gap, revealing that women earn 32.1% less than men (for bonuses the gap is even bigger at 40.7%).\n\nBeale said she was \u201cnot proud of that at all\u201d and that Lloyd\u2019s was taking action, having signed up to the government\u2019s women in finance charter and introduced a back to work programme for parents. Its goal is to have women in 40% of its top management jobs in the next five years, up from 33.8% today.\n\nWomen were not allowed into the Lloyd\u2019s underwriting room until 1973, when Liliana Archibald became the first female broker there.\n\nLloyd\u2019s reiterated that its new office in Brussels would be up and running by July, ready to start writing business in January.

In October 2016, we revisited our study area by conducting two flights with a Hercules C-130 aircraft that collected aerial imagery (n = 7,298 single-frame mosaics) to better quantify the larger and rarer >50 cm plastic objects (Fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1 Field monitoring effort. Vessel (grey and dark blue lines) and aircraft (light blue lines) tracks and locations where data on buoyant ocean plastic concentrations were collected (circles). Grey circles (n = 350) represent areas sampled with a single Manta net tow by 17 participating vessels, between July and September 2015. Dark blue circles (n = 76) represent areas sampled with paired Manta and paired Mega net tows by RV Ocean Starr, between July and August 2015. Light blue circles (n = 31) show locations of RGB geo-referenced mosaics collected from a C-130 Hercules aircraft, in October 2016. This map was created using QGIS version 2.18.1 (www.qgis.org). Full size image\n\nVessels carried out net tows of 0.35\u20134 hours duration, while navigating at 0.7\u20136.8 knots. All trawls were designed to move away from the vessel to avoid wake effects on the capture efficiency of the devices. All vessel crews were trained with online material and one-to-one workshops that had been conducted prior to departure. While towing the trawl, the most experienced sailor aboard the vessel estimated the sea state (Beaufort scale) by measuring wind speeds and observing wave heights. This data was recorded in the standard datasheets provided, alongside the date, duration, as well as initial and final coordinates of each tow. The location and length of all net tows were confirmed during the post-processing phase by inspecting the position data from GPS trackers installed on all participating vessels. Most sampling stations encompassed a single net tow (n = 350 sampling stations) using a Manta trawl (0.5 mm square mesh, 90 cm \u00d7 15 cm mouth), which is one of the standard devices for quantifying plastic pollution levels. With the largest participating vessel (RV Ocean Starr), we simultaneously towed two Manta trawls, alongside two large Neuston trawls (1.5 cm square mesh, 6 m \u00d7 1.5 m mouth, of which 0.5 m above the water line; thereafter called \u2018Mega trawls\u2019) at every sampling location (n = 76 stations). After each Manta net tow, the net was rinsed from the outside with seawater, and its single-use cod-end removed, closed with staples and placed in an individual zip-lock bag. After each Mega trawl tow, the net was also rinsed from the outside with seawater and its large cod-end opened in a box filled with seawater. All buoyant plastics were then removed, wrapped in aluminium and placed in labelled plastic bags. The whole content captured by the Manta trawls was stored, while the organisms captured by the Mega trawls (mostly alive) were released back into the ocean. All samples were stored in a fridge or freezer while at-sea, and in a FedEx cool box (2\u20138 \u00b0C) or reefer (\u22122 \u00b0C) while being shipped to the laboratory. Even though we were careful when handling samples, some debris items may have been broken during transportation, leading to some bias in our debris size distribution. Detailed information related to these net tows (i.e. coordinates, metocean conditions, sampling times and durations) is provided in Figshare33.\n\nThe aerial surveys sampled a far greater area (311.0 km2) than the trawl surveys described above (3.9 km2 and 13.6 km2, for Manta and Mega net tows, respectively), thus yielding a more reliable quantification of debris larger than 50 cm, which are relatively rare. Both flights started and ended at Moffett Airfield near Mountain View, California. The first aerial survey was conducted on October 2nd 2016 sampling from 18:56 to 21:14 UTC time, at a constant latitude of 33.5\u00b0N, and longitudes varying from 141.4\u00b0W to 134.9\u00b0W. The second survey started on October 6th 2016 sampling from 22:14 to 0:37 UTC, from 30.1\u00b0N, 143.7\u00b0W to 32.9\u00b0N, 138.1\u00b0W. While in survey mode, the aircraft flew at an altitude of approximately 400 m and at a ground speed of 140 knots. Sampling transects targeted areas where the sea state conditions were the lowest, based on the weather forecast, including sea surface atmospheric pressure, cloud cover, wind speed at 10 m above sea level and boundary surface layer height provided by NOAA\u2019s Global Forecasting System, as well as significant wave height and peak period data distributed by NOAA\u2019s WaveWatch3 model outputs. Even though we surveyed floating debris using trained observers and three types of sensor (Lidar, SWIR imager, and RGB camera), here we only analyse information coming from the geo-referenced mosaics produced by a RGB camera (CS-4800i) that generally took photographs every second during surveying time (frame size = ~360 m across track, ~240 m along track, ~0.1 m resolution).\n\nTrawl samples processing\n\nTrawl samples were separately washed into a sieve tower (five Glenammer Engineering Ltd sieves, with 0.05 cm, 0.15 cm, 0.5 cm, 1.5 cm, and 5 cm square apertures) that divided the material into the following size classes: 0.05\u20130.15 cm, 0.15\u20130.5 cm, 0.5\u20131.5 cm, 1.5\u20135 cm, and >5 cm. Debris items >5 cm were then manually sorted into 5\u201310 cm, 10\u201350 cm, and >50 cm classes by measuring the object lengths (widest dimension of the object) with a ruler. Buoyant debris was separated from biomass by placing the material within each sieve in filtered saltwater (salinity 3.5%, temperature 19\u201323 \u00b0C). Lab personnel stirred the material many times to insure floating particles were detached from the biomass material. Floating objects identified as buoyant debris were manually extracted from the water surface using forceps, separated into types, and counted. Buoyant debris was classified into material type (plastic, glass, paraffin, tar, rubber, wood, pumice, seed or unknown), with plastics being further divided into the following categories: (1) \u2018H\u2019 type \u2013 fragments and objects made of hard plastic, plastic sheet or film; (2) \u2018N\u2019 type \u2013 plastic lines, ropes, and fishing nets; (3) \u2018P\u2019 type \u2013 pre-production plastic pellets in the shape of a cylinder, disk or sphere; and (4) \u2018F\u2019 type \u2013 fragments or objects made of foamed material (e.g. expanded polystyrene). Once counted and categorized, the pieces were washed with distilled water, transferred to aluminium dishes, dried overnight at 60 \u00b0C, and weighed using an OHAUS Explorer EX324M (0.0001 g readability) for objects <5 cm, and a OHAUS Explorer EX12001M (0.1 g readability) for objects >5 cm.\n\nTo best characterize the ocean plastic accumulating within the GPGP, we performed additional analyses with the material collected. Firstly, 10 pieces within each plastic size/type category (n = 220 pieces) were selected for polymer composition analysis by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The readings were done using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR equipped with a universal ATR accessory (range = 600\u20134000 cm\u22121). The respective polymer type was determined by comparing sample FT-IR spectra against known spectra from a database (Perkin-Elmer ATR of Polymers Library). Secondly, we screened all plastic debris collected for production dates, as well as any writings statements giving information on its origin (i.e. language and \u2018made in\u2019 statements). Lastly, we classified plastic items from \u2018H\u2019 and \u2018L\u2019 types collected at 30 RV Ocean Starr stations into object types (e.g. bottle lids, bags, bottles, etc). As \u2018H\u2019 objects larger than 50 cm were relatively rare, we analysed 10 extra RV Ocean Starr stations for this type/size category. If the object type of a fragment could not be determined, we classified the piece as either hard plastic fragment or film fragment depending on its wall thickness and flexibility34. We used Manta trawl samples to characterise objects within size classes 0.15\u20130.5 cm, 0.5\u20131.5 cm, and 1.5\u20135 cm, and Mega trawl samples to characterise objects within size classes 5\u201310 cm, 10\u201350 cm, and >50 cm. Plastics within our smallest size class (0.05\u20130.15 cm) were not considered in this \u2018Object Type\u2019 analysis due to the difficulty of handling and identifying small fragments.\n\nThe numerical/mass concentrations of buoyant plastic items (count/kg of plastic per km2 of sea surface) measured by each net tow were calculated for all plastic size/type categories separately. To do so, we divided the count and weight of plastic objects within each category by the towed area of the sample. We calculated the towed area by multiplying net mouth width (90 cm for Manta trawl, 6 m for Mega trawl) by tow length (determined from GPS position data). The average area covered by Manta net tows was 0.008 km2 (SD = 0.004, min\u2013max: 0.001\u20130.018 km2), while the average area covered by Mega net tows was 0.090 km2, (SD = 0.013, min\u2013max: 0.046\u20130.125 km2). As buoyant plastics can be missed by surface trawls due to wind-driven mixing, we then estimated the \u2018depth-integrated\u2019 mass and numerical plastic concentrations (Ci) for all type/size categories at each of the trawl sampling locations using the equations described in ref.35. Supplementary Methods 1 provides details on how Ci was calculated as a function of ocean plastic terminal rising velocity (Wb), depth sampled by the trawl, and sea state. It also describes how we measured Wb for each of the type/size categories of this study. After comparing plastic concentration results obtained by paired Manta and Mega net tows (n = 76 locations), we decided to use Manta and Mega trawl samples to quantify debris 0.05\u20135 cm and 5\u201350 cm in size, respectively. The comparison results and reasoning behind such decision in provided in Supplementary Methods 2.\n\nAerial imagery processing\n\nAll RGB images taken during our survey flights (n = 7,298) were georeferenced using accurate aircraft position and altitude data collected during the surveys. They were then inspected by two trained observers and a detection algorithm. Observers inspected all images at full-screen on a Samsung HD monitor (LU28E590DS/XY) and those single-frame mosaics containing debris were uploaded into QGIS software (Version 2.18.3\u2013Las Palmas) to record their position and characteristics. We trust we had a very small number of false positives and a high number of false negatives. This is because the observers took a conservative approach: they only logged features as debris when they were very confident with its identification. As such, many features that could be debris, but resembled other natural features, such as sun glint and breaking wave, were not logged into our ocean plastic dataset. Once this work was finalised, we ran an experimental algorithm capable of detecting potential debris in all our RGB mosaics as a quality control step. To avoid any false positives, all features detected by the algorithm were also visually inspected by an observer and only those visually identified as debris were logged in our QGIS database. For every sighting, we recorded position (latitude, longitude), length (widest dimension of the object), width, and object type: (1) \u2018bundled net\u2019 \u2013 a group of fishing nets bundled tightly together; they are commonly colourful and of a rounded shape; (2) \u2018loose net\u2019 \u2013 a single fishing net; they were generally quite translucent and rectangular in shape; (3) \u2018container\u2019 \u2013 rectangular and bright objects, such as fishing crates and drums; (4) \u2018rope\u2019 \u2013 long cylindrical objects around 15 cm thick; (5) \u2018buoy/lid\u2019, rounded bright objects that could be either a large lid or a buoy; (6) \u2018unknown\u2019 \u2013 objects that are clearly debris but whose object type was not identified, they were mostly irregular-shaped items resembling plastic fragments; and (7) Other \u2013 only one object was successfully identified but did not belong to any category above: a life ring. We recorded 1,595 debris items (403 and 1,192 in flights 1 and 2 respectively); 626 were 10\u201350 cm and 969 were >50 cm in length. Most of them were classified as \u2018unknown\u2019 (78% for 10\u201350 cm, 32% for >50 cm), followed by \u2018buoy or lid\u2019 (20%) and \u2018bundled net\u2019 (1%) for 10\u201350 cm debris, and by \u2018bundled net\u2019 (29%), \u2018container\u2019 (18%), \u2018buoy or lid\u2019 (9%), \u2018rope\u2019 (6%), and \u2018lose net\u2019 (4%) for >50 cm debris. To calculate ocean plastic concentrations, we grouped the geo-referenced images into 31 ~10 km2 mosaics. For numerical concentrations, we simply divided the number of debris pieces 10\u201350 cm and >50 cm within each mosaic by the area covered. To estimate mass concentrations, we had to first estimate the mass of each object spotted, then we separately summed the mass of 10\u201350 cm and >50 cm debris within each mosaic by the area covered. More information on how we estimated the mass of each spotted objects is provided in Supplementary Methods 3.\n\nNumerical model formulation\n\nOcean plastic pathways can be represented by Lagrangian particle trajectories31. In our framework, particles were advected by the following environmental drivers: sea surface currents, wave induced Stokes drift and winds. Starting from identical particle releases, we produced a series of forcing scenarios to represent the diversity in shape and composition of ocean plastics. Starting from using sea surface current only, we gradually added forcing terms representing the actions of atmospheric drag and wind waves on buoyant debris. The action of wind was simulated by considering the displacement of particles as a fraction of wind speed at 10 m above sea level. This is referred as the \u2018windage coefficient\u2019. We assessed different windage coefficient scenarios including 0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 2% and 3%. We sourced global sea surface currents (1993 to 2012) from the HYCOM + NCODA global 1/12\u00b0 reanalysis (experiment 19.0 and 19.136,37,38), and wind (10 m above sea level) speed and direction data (1993 to 2012) from NCEP/NCAR global reanalysis39. Wave induced Stokes drift amplitude was calculated using wave spectrum bulk coefficients (significant wave height, peak wave period and direction) from Wavewatch3 model outputs40.\n\nFor every forcing scenario, particles were identically and continuously released in time from 1993 to 2012 following spatial distributions and amplitudes of significant ocean plastic sources on land (coastal population hotspots23 and major rivers24) as well as at sea (fishing26,41, aquaculture42 and shipping industries43). Source scenarios were combined using relative source contribution as well as geographical distribution presented in Supplementary Methods 4. We advected global particles in time using the forcing scenarios described above and successfully reproduced the formation of oceanic garbage patches, with the shape and gradient of particle concentrations in these areas differing amongst forcing scenarios. We computed daily particle visits over 0.2\u00b0 resolution grids corresponding to our observation domain and extending from 160\u00b0W to 120\u00b0W in longitude and 20\u00b0N to 45\u00b0N in latitude. The number of daily particle visits was uniformized over the total number of particles present in the global model at a given time. The model-predicted non-dimensional concentration \u03b4 i of cell i, was calculated as follows:\n\n\u03b4 i = \u2211 s \u03b1 s \u03b4 i , s (1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 s is the non-dimensional weight relative to the contribution of source s and \u03b4 i,s is the percentage of global particles from source s in cell i. \u03b4 i,s is calculated with the number of particles n i,s from source s in cell i over the total number of global particles \u03a3 i n s from source s:\n\n\u03b4 i , s = n i , s \u2211 i n s (2)\n\nNumerical model calibration\n\nWe collected measurements at sea in 2015 and 2016, but our numerical model uses ocean circulation reanalysis covering the period from 1993 to 2012. Modelled ocean circulation data post-2012 is available from HYCOM however not as a reanalysis product. As such, we decided not to use it in this study. As initial model particles released in 1993 significantly start to accumulate in the area after about 7 years, we averaged uniformized daily particle visits over 12 years, from 2000 to 2012. We grouped observed debris size classes in four categories: microplastics (0.05\u20130.5 cm), mesoplastics (0.5\u20135 cm), macroplastics (5\u201350 cm) and megaplastics (>50 cm). We compared model predictions against depth-integrated microplastic concentrations as this dataset collected by Manta trawls had the largest spatial coverage. Mass concentrations derived from trawl measurements were grouped in 0.2-degree resolution cells and compared against model-predicted non-dimensional concentration \u03b4 for the five different forcing scenarios. The best model fit was found for the forcing scenario with sea-surface current only (R2 = 0.52, n = 277 cells). The regression coefficient declined as we increased the atmospheric drag term (R2 = 0.39 to 0.21 depending on windage coefficient).\n\nAs we analysed the accumulation of model particles in the GPGP region, we noticed significant seasonal and inter-annual variations of the GPGP position. The modelled GPGP dimensions was relatively consistent throughout our 12 years of analysis, but the relative position of this accumulation zone varied with years and seasons. We first decided to test our model for seasonal variation by comparing our microplastic concentrations (measured in July \u2013 September 2015) against modelled concentrations averages for the July\u2013September periods of 2000 to 2012. This comparison yielded poorer results (R2 = 0.46 to 0.21, depending on forcing scenario) than with the 12 years average solution (R2 = 0.52) as the July\u2013September GPGP position varied substantially among years.\n\nThe relation between the accumulation of marine debris in the North Pacific and climate events such as El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has previously been discussed18. As such, to account for inter-annual variation, we compared latitudinal and longitudinal position of the GPGP against these two climate indexes: ENSO and PDO. We found that 2002 and 2004 were similar to the conditions experienced during our multi-vessel expedition. Thus, we compared our measurements against particle visit averages for July\u2013September of 2002 and 2004 combined. This second attempt exhibited better results (R2 = 0.58 to 0.41, depending on forcing scenario), suggesting that climatic events such as ENSO or PDO influence the average position of the GPGP. Therefore, we decided to use the July\u2013September average for 2002 and 2004, which better accounts for inter-annual variations in the GPGP position. More information on the selection of years for calibrating the model against trawl and aerial surveys data is provided in Supplementary Methods 5. The best fit between model predictions and microplastic observations was found once again for the forcing scenario with sea surface current only (R2 = 0.58, n = 277). The best regression fit between measured and modelled microplastic concentrations had a = \u22128.3068 and b = 0.6770 in the parametric formulation:\n\nc m o d = 10 log 10 \u03b4 \u2212 a b (3)\n\nFrom this formulation, we computed the modelled microplastics mass concentration in our domain area and extracted contour levels by order of magnitude, from 0.01 g km\u22122 to 10 kg km\u22122. The GPGP as defined in this study corresponds to the 1 kg km\u22122 microplastic mass concentration level covering an area of 1.6 million km2 and depicted as a bold line in Fig. 2a. As a validation, we categorized microplastics measurements inside and outside the 1 kg km\u22122 contour line (Fig. 2b). For stations inside the model-predicted GPGP, the median measured microplastic concentration was 1.8 kg km\u22122 (25th\u201375th percentiles = 3.5\u20130.9 kg km\u22122) while for stations outside, the median was 0.3 kg km\u22122 (25th\u201375th percentiles = 0.2\u20130.7 kg km\u22122). Using our calibrated microplastics distribution, we computed the mass and numerical concentration for individual size classes from scaling modelled concentrations by the ratio between average modelled microplastics distribution inside the GPGP and averaged measured concentrations per size class of stations inside the patch. A comparison between measured and modelled mass/numerical concentrations for all ocean plastic size classes is given in Fig. 2c and d.\n\nFigure 2 Numerical model calibration. (a) The GPGP boundary (blue line) is estimated by comparing microplastic concentration measurements (circles) to model particle visit averages that accounted for seasonal and inter-annual variations. This map was created using QGIS version 2.18.1 (www.qgis.org).

(c) Measured mass concentrations versus modelled mass concentrations for microplastics, mesoplastics, macroplastics and megaplastics. (d) Same as (c) but with numerical concentrations. Full size image\n\nOur confidence intervals were formulated to account for uncertainties in both sampling and modelling. For the trawl collection (i.e. micro-, meso- and macroplastics), we considered uncertainties related to the vertical-mixing corrections applied to surface concentrations using reported sea state and plastic\u2019s rising velocities (see Supplementary Methods 1). For the aerial mosaics, we accounted for uncertainties related to estimating the mass of sighted objects based on correlations between top-view area and dry weight of objects collected in the trawls (see Supplementary Methods 3). Finally, to account for modelling uncertainties, we added (respectively subtracted) the standard error of measured concentration to (resp. from) the mean upper (resp. lower) mass concentration when scaling the microplastics distribution to individual size classes.\n\nCharacterisation by types, sources and forcing scenarios\n\nThe total estimated mass load of ocean plastic in the GPGP by size classes were further divided by types. We calculated the average fraction in mass of individual ocean plastic types per sampling event for stations inside the patch (Supplementary Table 1) and derived the contribution of types \u2018H\u2019, \u2018N\u2019, \u2018F\u2019 and \u2018P\u2019. Further, as we predominantly observed debris originated from marine sources, we investigated the source contribution predicted by our calibrated modelled distribution. For individual model cells, we calculated the percentage of Lagrangian particle visits from individual sources. As initial particles were weighted in accordance to estimated global inputs, model particles from marine sources originally represented 28.1% of the total amount of material with fishing (17.9%), aquaculture (1.3%) and shipping (8.9%). We calculated the difference from this initial percentage value for each model cell and reported it to the predicted total mass concentration. In doing so, we defined \u2018anomalies\u2019 in marine source contribution in the North Pacific and expressed these in unit of mass per surface area. Finally, even though our calibrated model considered sea surface current only, we compared the predominance of forcing scenarios by evaluating the respective number of particle visits for each model cells. We computed contours around the GPGP for individual forcing scenarios in a way that the material contained inside each contour is equal to our initial forcing scenario (i.e. sea surface current only).\n\nThe dependence of the particle trajectory on the windage coefficient predicted by our model is in good agreement with sightings and modelling of debris originated from the 2011 Tohoku tsunami in Japan44,45. The first identified Japanese debris items that arrived after 10 to 12 months on the North American shores were objects with high windage such as buoys, boats and floating docks. Debris also arrived on Hawaiian Islands 18 months after the incident. The time of arrival was closely related to object types, starting in the first year with large oyster farm buoys and other floats, containers, and canisters. In the second year more buoys, tipped boats, fridges, and pallets arrived, followed later by timber beams and wooden debris. Our model predicted that only objects with a windage coefficient above 3% could arrive on Hawaii in the second year after the 2011 tsunami. Objects with windage coefficient ranging from 1 to 2% would reach Hawaii during the third year, while objects with no windage would mostly accumulate in the GPGP, north east of the archipelago.\n\nLong term analysis\n\nThe definition of a dynamic GPGP boundary that accounts for seasonal and inter-annual variabilities allowed us to estimate which sea surface trawl data points from the literature are inside or outside the GPGP region. Therefore, we used our calibrated model to assess the decadal evolution of microplastic mass concentrations (kg km\u22122) within and around the GPGP. Concentration data from the literature (Supplementary Table 2) was obtained from published datasets or digitized from figures when not available digitally17,46,47. When data was reported in unit of mass per volume of water48, we used the net tow depth to calculate the concentration per surface area unit. When only numerical concentration was reported22,48, we estimated mass concentration by using the average ocean plastic mass from net tows where both mass and numerical concentrations were reported (m = 3.53 mg, SE: 0.10 mg, n = 872).\n\nWe compared the model-predicted GPGP boundary with the locations of samples collected between 1999 and 201221,22,48,49. Samples collected before 199917,46,47,48 were compared against the GPGP position estimated for the sampled months and years in the 1999\u20132012 period that had similar ENSO and PDO values (See Supplementary Methods 6). Using our dynamic GPGP model boundary as reference, we classified each net tow into 3 categories: (1) sampled within the GPGP boundary, (2) sampled outside the GPGP boundary, but above 20\u00b0N and below 45\u00b0N and (3) sampled in the rest of the North Pacific. We only used net tows from the first two categories above so that concentration statistics for outside the patch were not biased by measurements taken in equatorial and polar waters, where concentrations were very low. We then grouped these microplastic concentration observations from plankton net trawls by decades, taking data recorded between 1965\u20131974 (n = 20 inside and n = 58 outside17,48), 1975\u20131984 (n = 0 inside and n = 19 outside46), 1985\u20131994 (n = 4 inside and n = 2 outside47), 1995\u20132004 (n = 2 inside and n = 252 outside22,49), 2005\u20132014 (n = 195 inside and n = 861 outside21,22,48) and finally 2015 (n = 288 inside and n = 213 outside; this study). We calculated the mean (\u00b1 standard error) of measured microplastic mass concentration per decades for within and around the GPGP boundary. Finally, we extracted decadal trends by fitting an exponential function (R2 = 0.94) assuming null concentrations at the beginning of the 20th century. The exponential fit exhibited better results than linear, quadratic or cubic functions (R2 = 0.71, R2 = 0.86 and R2 = 0.91, respectively).", "title": "Evidence that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is rapidly accumulating plastic"}, {"url": "https://www.theoceancleanup.com/press/great-pacific-garbage-patch-growing-rapidly-study-shows/", "content": "This site makes use of third-party cookies for analytics.

(Photo: The Ocean Cleanup)\n\nThe world's largest collection of ocean garbage is growing.\n\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a collection of plastic, floating trash halfway between Hawaii and California, has grown to more than 600,000 square miles, a study published Thursday found. That's twice the size of Texas.\n\nWinds and converging ocean currents funnel the garbage into a central location, said study lead author Laurent Lebreton of the Ocean Cleanup Foundation, a non-profit organization that spearheaded the research.\n\nFirst discovered in the early 1990s, the trash in the patch comes from around the Pacific Rim, including nations in Asia and North and South America, Lebreton said.\n\nThe patch is not a solid mass of plastic. It includes about 1.8 trillion pieces and weighs 88,000 tons \u2014 the equivalent of 500 jumbo jets. The new figures are as much as 16 times higher than previous estimates.\n\nThe research \u2014 the most complete study undertaken of the garbage patch \u2014 was published Thursday in the peer-reviewed journal Scientific Reports.\n\n\"We were surprised by the amount of large plastic objects we encountered,\u201d said Julia Reisser of the foundation. \u201cWe used to think most of the debris consists of small fragments, but this new analysis shines a new light on the scope of the debris.\"\n\nThe study was based on a three-year mapping effort by an international team of scientists affiliated with the Ocean Cleanup Foundation, six universities and an aerial sensor company.\n\nMore: Our trash harms the deepest fish in the ocean\n\nMore: Humans have produced 18.2 trillion pounds of plastic since the '50s. That's equal in size to 1 billion elephants.\n\nSadly, the Pacific patch isn't alone. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is the largest of five such trash collections in the ocean, Lebreton said.\n\nCLOSE This video shows the devastating plastic waste that is overtaking the waters near Bali. Buzz60\n\nScientists work with the European Space Agency to take photos of the garbage patches from space.\n\nNo governments have stepped up to clean the trash, which is in international waters, so it's up to privately funded groups such as the Ocean Cleanup Foundation to take the lead in getting rid of the garbage.\n\nThere's a sense of urgency, said Joost Dubois, a spokesman with the foundation.\n\n\"It's a ticking time bomb of larger material,\" Dubois said. \"We've got to get it before it breaks down into a size that's too small to collect and also dangerous for marine life.\"\n\nSince plastic has been around only since the 1950s, there's no way of knowing exactly how long it will last in the ocean. If left alone, the plastic could remain there for decades, centuries or even longer.\n\n\"Unless we begin to remove it, some would say it may remain there forever,\" Lebreton said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2GeRHO8", "title": "Pacific garbage patch, largest collection of ocean trash, grows"}, {"url": "://story/dgoxP3Ls0mOzuiM?ned=us", "content": "", "title": ""}, {"url": "http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/mar/08/after-a-self-imposed-hiatus-seattles-bryan-john-ap/", "content": "Seattle singer/songwriter Bryan John Appleby\u2019s most recent tweet was posted Feb. 21, 2017.\n\nIn it, he praises an essay by writer Ijeoma Oluo called \u201cWhite People: I Don\u2019t Want You to Understand Me Better, I Want You to Understand Yourselves.\u201d\n\nHe was a little more active on Facebook last year, posting sporadically about small tours and one-off shows.\n\nAfter taking a bit of a self-imposed hiatus from his own music in 2017, Appleby is getting back into the swing of things with a handful of headlining gigs, including a stop at the Bartlett on Friday.\n\nAppleby\u2019s hiatus came a year after the release of his sophomore album \u201cThe Narrow Valley,\u201d a concept album that begins with an earthquake hitting a small California town and goes onto explore moments in the lives of the townspeople before the earthquake hit.\n\nIt\u2019s a sweeping orchestral pop record with a story brought to life through Appleby\u2019s cinematic lyrics.\n\n\u201cThe Fault Line cracked a long smile/A hideous rock-tooth grin open wide/\u2026A broken bedside vase, then our books flew from their case/And the walls began to shed their plaster hides,\u201d Appleby sings on the opening track \u201cThe Fault Line.\u201d\n\nAs a songwriter, Appleby has always looked to visual arts for inspiration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m finding just as much to get excited about in watching movies or reading really descriptive literature as I am in finding ideas in other people\u2019s music,\u201d he said. \u201cMusical inspiration is definitely just one brick in the wall of inspiration. It\u2019s not necessarily even the cornerstone.\u201d\n\nThe first half of 2016 found Appleby and his band touring in support of the album. But after the initial bout of promotion passed and funds began to dwindle, Appleby made the decision to begin touring solo.\n\nAppleby can see himself putting together a band for a show or two here and there, but for the time being, he\u2019s enjoying the freedom performing solo has afforded him.\n\n\u201cThat shift in emphasis definitely gave me moments of freedom and a little bit more air as far as not having restraints or needing to make things work on a large scale for a whole team of folks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m no longer carrying all of that weight and therefore can re-examine my relationship to all sorts of things but specifically reexamine my relationship to the industry and the album cycle and all the built in, baked in expectations of turnaround time.\u201d\n\nWith a new leisurely approach to performing and the music industry, Appleby decided to switch gears from the guitar to the drums, the first instrument he learned to play.\n\nHe backed friend Garett van der Spek, who performs as Prism Tats, for what was supposed to be one show but ended up performing nearly two dozen shows with him last year.\n\nHe also played guitar with Seattle\u2019s Tomten.\n\nAppleby saw his time out of the spotlight as a chance for his well of inspiration to fill up again, though he also used it as a chance to step back at a time when another man was doing plenty of talking.\n\n\u201cMy narrative and my experience, I didn\u2019t feel like exploring that publicly in a moment when all of a sudden there\u2019s a really loud white guy in charge of everything in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just felt like a better year to be listening than it did to be declaring things.\u201d\n\nAfter a year of listening and with a well of inspiration filled with \u201chundreds of 42-second voice memos from the last two years,\u201d Appleby has once again picked up the guitar and is in the process of writing new music.\n\nWhile he\u2019s grateful for the work of producers Sam Anderson, on \u201cThe Narrow Valley,\u201d and Kevin Watley, on 2011\u2019s \u201cFire on the Vine,\u201d and he\u2019s proud of the \u201ccinematic, layered, lush\u201d feel of \u201cThe Narrow Valley,\u201d Appleby doesn\u2019t think his next two or three records will be as expansive.\n\nFor one thing, he doesn\u2019t want to go into debt to release an album, as he\u2019s still paying off the debt from \u201cThe Narrow Valley.\u201d\n\nBut he\u2019s also curious to see the kind of music he can make when, as he put it, he doesn\u2019t have bells and whistles to rely on.\n\n\u201cWhat is the kernel of an idea? What\u2019s the thing that really is good here?\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on polishing that rather than paying a bunch of people to make it sound really, really cool.\u201d\n\nAnd, as silly as it sounds, Appleby is looking forward to finding out, more than 10 years into his career, what he sounds like.\n\nHe said though \u201cThe Narrow Valley\u201d and \u201cFire on the Vine\u201d were released under his name, the albums were fairly collaborative efforts with Anderson and Watley, with 50 percent, the lyrics, chords and melodies, coming from Appleby and the other 50 percent, the character of the sound and how the albums were voiced, coming from the producers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing I\u2019m excited to explore,\u201d he said. \u201cFor better or for worse, what does it sound like when it\u2019s 90 percent me with a few friends here and there rather than these grand gestures with a producer?\u201d", "title": "After a self-imposed hiatus, Seattle\u2019s Bryan John Appleby returns to center stage"}, {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02784-7", "content": "The eruption of Mount St Helens in 1980 caused the deaths of 57 people.Credit: KPA/Zuma/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe world needs to do more to prepare for the next huge volcanic eruption, a team of leading scientists says.\n\nThe devastating Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 and the T\u014dhoku earthquake in Japan in 2011 highlighted some of the worst-case scenarios for natural disasters. But humanity has not had to deal with a cataclysmic volcanic disaster since at least 1815, when the eruption of Tambora in Indonesia killed tens of thousands of people and led to a \u2018year without a summer\u2019 in Europe and North America. Such world-altering blasts rank at 7 or more on the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) scale of eruptions, which goes to 8.\n\n\u201cThe next VEI-7 eruption could occur within our lifetimes, or it could be hundreds of years down the road,\u201d says Chris Newhall, a volcanologist with the Mirisbiris Garden and Nature Center in Santo Domingo, Philippines. But the time to have this discussion is now, he says, so that researchers and government officials can plan and prepare before an emergency strikes.\n\nNewhall is the lead author of a paper published last week in Geosphere1 that explores the potential consequences of the next VEI-7 eruption. His co-authors are volcanologist Stephen Self of the University of California, Berkeley \u2014 with whom Newhall devised the VEI scale2 in 1982 \u2014 and Alan Robock, a climate scientist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. All three have researched the VEI-5 eruption of Mount St Helens in Washington state in 1980, and the VEI-6 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991.\n\nThose events killed dozens to hundreds of people and disrupted entire regions. Pinatubo even spewed enough sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to cause global cooling. But a VEI-7 eruption would be of an entirely different scale. In 1257, a VEI-7 eruption in what is now Indonesia probably cooled the planet down enough to kick off a centuries-long cold snap called the Little Ice Age, Robock says. \u201cThese things are hugely important for the planet, but the next one will take place in quite a different environment,\u201d he adds.\n\nA globalized world\n\nAgriculture, health care, financial systems and other aspects of modern life are much more globally interconnected than they were just a few decades ago, the scientists say. Eight years ago, an eruption that ranked at just VEI 3 \u2014 Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull, in Iceland \u2014 grounded European air traffic for days because of the danger of flying through volcanic ash. The event caused an estimated US$5 billion in economic losses.\n\nNewhall\u2019s team says that researchers should start to prepare for a VEI-7 eruption by studying potential effects on crucial communications links \u2014 such as how atmospheric moisture and volcanic ash can interfere with global positioning system signals. Others could work to improve their understanding of how large amounts of magma accumulate and erupt, helping scientists to forecast where the next VEI-7 event might occur.\n\nThe researchers already have a long list of candidate volcanoes that might be capable of a VEI-7 blast. They include Taupo in New Zealand, site of the world\u2019s last VEI-8 eruption \u2014 26,500 years ago \u2014 and Iran\u2019s Mount Damavand, which lies just 50 kilometres from Tehran.\n\nPreparing for rare but deadly eruptions is as important as dealing with smaller, more-frequent ones, says Janine Krippner, a volcanologist at Concord University in Athens, West Virginia. \u201cEven with the lower probability of these larger events, when they do occur people will look to scientists, emergency managers, governments and other entities and expect them to be prepared,\u201d she says. \u201cWe owe it to our communities to be researching potentially devastating eruptions, so we can guide people on what to do.\u201d", "title": "Volcanologists warn world is unprepared for next major eruption"}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2018/03/photos-of-the-week-the-sydney-skinny-a-glacial-arch-pelicans-at-play/555797/", "content": "Skijoring in Montana, a Russian presidential candidate in Moscow, economic disparity in Manila, a walkout against gun violence across the United States, civilians fleeing the battlefields of Syria, ski mountaineering in France, a balloon designer in Australia, the stark and lonely route of a German volunteer mailman in Schleswig-Holstein, and much more.", "title": "Photos of the Week: the Sydney Skinny, a Glacial Arch, Pelicans at Play"}, {"url": "http://wamc.org/post/blair-horner-fukushima-anniversary-and-ny-s-subsidies-nuclear-power", "content": "Last weekend was the seventh anniversary of the disaster at the Japanese nuclear power plant located in Fukushima. On March 11, 2011, an earthquake occurred in the Pacific Ocean that spawned a huge tsunami. The quake itself caused considerable damage to the Japanese islands near the center of the quake, but the tsunami\u2019s impact was catastrophic.\n\nThe waves caused by the earthquake hit the Fukushima area with such force that over one million buildings were partially or completely destroyed and about 19,000 residents were killed.\n\nAt the same time, eleven reactors at four nuclear power plants in the region were forced to shut down. However, the tsunami disabled the emergency generators that would have provided power to control and operate the pumps necessary to cool the superheated reactors. The insufficient cooling led to three nuclear meltdowns, hydrogen-air explosions, and the release of radioactive material during the next few days after the tsunami hit.\n\nThe result of this disaster forced tens of thousands of Japanese to relocate from the area and the uncontrolled release of radioactive materials into the area and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe power plants in Fukushima are of the same design as some in New York State, which are located on Lake Ontario. While no one would expect the same scenario to occur, those plants have been the focus of state policies in recent years.\n\nThe plants, built in the 1960s, have exceeded their expected useful lifetimes. Generally, plants of that design and era are expected to be used for roughly 40 or so years. Yet those plants continue to operate under a deal negotiated largely outside of public view.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, negotiators from the Cuomo Administration and the plant owners agreed to a multi-billion dollar bailout of the plants \u2013 which were slated for closure. At that time, the state did not reveal the estimated costs, but subsequent analyses estimated that the costs could run anywhere from $2.9 billion to $7.6 billion over a 12-year period. The negotiation contained no new safety requirements for the plants, just a guarantee that virtually all New Yorkers would be required to pay to make the nuke plants profitable \u2013 whether they received power from the plants or not \u2013 to keep them open.\n\nThe safety records of the plants came under new scrutiny in a report issued last week by the Alliance for a Green Economy, an upstate New York nuclear watchdog organization. The report analyzed recent inspection reports and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) documents and identified three issues of concern:\n\nThe group identified regulatory violations without penalties: 18 violations of Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were reported between March 2017 and February 2018 for the four Upstate reactors, but no penalties or fines were assessed.\n\nThe group identified examples of weakened regulations at the request of nuclear operators. For example, at the request of one of the plant\u2019s owners, the National Regulatory Commission changed the requirement for what constitutes an \u201cunusual event\u201d regarding Lake Ontario flooding. As we all know, there had been extensive flooding last year in the Lake Ontario area.\n\nLastly, the group identified missed deadlines for fixing known safety and maintenance issues: one plant near Oswego does not have a containment vessel likely to be able to contain the pressure and radiation released by a meltdown and installation of a required vent has been delayed; the plant\u2019s owner is behind schedule for fixing numerous maintenance issues.\n\nNew York State should learn the lessons of the dangers of relying on nuclear power and follow the path set by California: move to shut down these aging facilities, and instead move toward greater reliance on solar, wind and geothermal power. Those power generators have been starved of adequate support since so much of the state\u2019s wealth is tied up in propping up the Lake Ontario plants. New York energy efficiency programs are anemic and lag far behind neighboring states and currently solar only generates about 1 percent of the power for the state. Instead of mandating that New Yorkers subsidize aging, inefficient, 20th century nuclear plants, that money should be redirected to 21st century conservation and renewable energy programs.\n\nBlair Horner is executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group.\n\nThe views expressed by commentators are solely those of the authors.

Photos by Thinkstock and YouTube.\n\nAlmost since its founding, Twitter has regarded itself as a platform for news; watershed moments in the company\u2019s history included the Arab Spring and a 2011 East Coast earthquake. Facebook began talking as early as 2013 about wanting to be a sort of \u201cpersonalized newspaper,\u201d only to realize more recently that separating real news from propaganda was harder than it had anticipated. Both companies have spent much of the past year reckoning with their roles in spreading hoaxes, facilitating election interference, and fueling societal division and extremism.\n\nGoogle\u2019s YouTube, in contrast, has until recently managed to skirt the brunt of the criticism that rival social media platforms have faced. As a result, it has been relatively slow to grapple with the implications of its role as a source of news\u2014and, inevitably, of misinformation. As recently as October, in a series of congressional hearings, Google downplayed the significance of its video platform in Russian election interference, while Facebook and Twitter fielded the toughest questions.\n\nNow a series of controversies is forcing YouTube to address its responsibilities more directly and candidly than it has in the past. At the South by Southwest Interactive conference this week in Austin, Texas, an appearance by YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki made it clear that the platform is finally giving serious thought to the quality and veracity of information its users are getting. It also made clear that the company has a lot of catching up to do.\n\nIn January, star YouTube vlogger Logan Paul sparked a backlash when he published a video showing the dead body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan. Google responded by canceling Paul\u2019s \u201cpreferred\u201d ad deal and suspending his projects for its premium video service, YouTube Red. That came as the company was already dealing with a series of reports revealing disturbing cartoons apparently aimed at kids (it subsequently deleted 150,000 of them) and another genre of videos depicting children in abusive situations. The latter prompted the company to hire thousands more human moderators to review content for potential policy violations.\n\nBut it has since become obvious that YouTube\u2019s problems aren\u2019t simply a matter of manpower. They flow from the company\u2019s confusion about the nature of its business and the extent of its responsibilities.\n\n.@SusanWojcicki \"If there is an important news event we want to be delivering the right information.\"\n\n\n\nMinutes later she says, \"We are not a news organization.\" \u2014 Ryan Mac (@RMac18) March 13, 2018\n\nIn February, YouTube\u2019s algorithms boosted conspiracy videos attacking the children who survived the Parkland, Florida, school massacre. This month, influential YouTube conspiracy theorist Alex Jones claimed the company was about to delete his channel, a claim YouTube said was not true. Writing in the New York Times this week, the tech scholar Zeynep Tufekci called YouTube \u201cthe great radicalizer,\u201d detailing how its recommendation algorithm carries casual viewers down rabbit holes of extremism.\n\nAt South by Southwest on Tuesday, Wojcicki came prepared with a new plan to tackle conspiracy videos on YouTube. But the subsequent reaction suggested she hadn\u2019t come quite prepared enough.\n\nPointing to slides that displayed YouTube videos purveying conspiracies about the moon landing and chemtrails, Wojcicki said the company will begin displaying \u201cinformation cues\u201d drawn from Wikipedia alongside such clips. The cues come in the form of little blocks of text directly below the video. To determine which videos require such a counterweight, Wojcicki said, YouTube will draw on Wikipedia\u2019s own list of well-known conspiracy theories. She noted that YouTube could expand on that list over time.\n\nThis was all news to the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that administers the volunteer-edited Wikipedia. \u201cWe were not given advance notice of this announcement,\u201d the foundation said in a statement Wednesday, adding that there is no formal partnership between it and YouTube. While it did not explicitly object to YouTube using its content in this way, the nonprofit stressed that it relies on donors and unpaid editors, and that it \u201cdoes not control content or make editorial decisions about information that is included on Wikipedia.\u201d\n\nIn other words, an $800 billion company\u2014arguably the world\u2019s most important information source\u2014is outsourcing the job of combatting misinformation on its platform to a nonprofit built on free labor. And it didn\u2019t bother to tell them.\n\nEven if YouTube had handled this better, it\u2019s not clear that Wikipedia cards will do much to solve its problems. The approach is loosely analogous to one that Facebook began deploying in December 2016 to fight fake news. But Facebook later ditched its initial approach amid concerns that it might be backfiring (a finding that is itself disputed by some). After a year\u2019s worth of research, testing, and trial and error, there\u2019s been little evidence so far that the social network\u2019s efforts have made much difference in the spread of misinformation. That\u2019s one reason Facebook has simultaneously pursued several other avenues to improve the quality and credibility of news and information on its platform\u2014some more promising than others.\n\nOne rather glaring problem with YouTube\u2019s plan is that it seems ill-equipped to handle conspiracies that crop up rapidly in the wake of major news events such as the Parkland shooting. Those memes\u2014such as the one smearing Parkland survivor David Hogg as a \u201ccrisis actor\u201d\u2014are liable to make the rounds on YouTube well before they\u2019ve been authoritatively debunked on Wikipedia, let alone added to a master list of well-known conspiracies. Even with human moderators on hand, some of these conspiracy theories have scaled to the top of YouTube\u2019s prominent list of trending videos, and earned millions of views in the process, before being taken down.\n\nAnother issue: Wikipedia is vulnerable to trolls and propagandists, just as is any other platform that relies on the public to produce and curate content. It might become more so, now that people know Wikipedia holds the keys to YouTube\u2019s conspiracy-debunking apparatus, such as it is. One prominent Wikipedia editor was quick to warn that YouTube\u2019s misinformation problems run deeper than anything that could be solved by an \u201cirregularly updated *encyclopedia*.\u201d\n\n...huh.\n\n\n\n1) ok, seems fine. Hope they credit us appropriately\n\n2) I don't think YouTube can rely on our irregularly updated *encyclopedia* to solve its ranking algorithm/hate speech issue; ppl don't read refs.\n\n3) web 2.0 is wierd, man.\n\n\n\n/goes back to working on Wikipedia articles https://t.co/f9G1JZLTu2 \u2014 Phoebe Ayers (@phoebe_ayers) March 14, 2018\n\nOn the same day that Wojcicki was taking the stage in Austin on Tuesday to announce her big fix, a YouTube spokesperson was telling Vice News that the company had no idea why an InfoWars conspiracy video was topping its search results Monday for queries about the package explosions in Austin. The InfoWars video claimed, without evidence, that Antifa was a \u201cprime suspect\u201d in the bombings.\n\nIn the same speech, according to tweets by BuzzFeed News\u2019 Ryan Mac, Wired editor-in-chief Nick Thompson asked Wojcicki how YouTube decides which information sources are credible. Wojcicki declined to get specific, saying \u201cthere are usually complicated algorithms\u201d\u2014the sort of vague excuse that Facebook shopped for years before critics largely stopped buying it. She did suggest, however, that YouTube looks at the \u201cnumber of journalistic awards\u201d and \u201camount of traffic\u201d that various publishers have. If that\u2019s true, those are some awfully crude, extremely amateurish proxies\u2014more so even than Facebook\u2019s widely ridiculed publisher trust survey.\n\nIt appears, then, that YouTube is just beginning the journey of reckoning that Facebook was compelled by critics (and its own outraged employees) to undertake almost immediately after the 2016 election. Part of that journey will probably involve learning some humility: Just last month Wojcicki sniped at a media conference in California that Facebook \u201cshould get back to baby pictures,\u201d the implication being that it couldn\u2019t handle the grown-up responsibilities of a prominent news platform. One could imagine a similar dig at YouTube, perhaps swapping out baby pictures for cat videos.\n\nThe reality is that none of these platforms is going back to its comparatively innocent early days. Social media, for better or worse, has firmly established itself as a primary news source for huge swaths of the population, with younger generations leading that trend. That means YouTube, like Facebook and Twitter, is stuck with the responsibility of figuring out how to do a better job of informing its users.

She speaks Monday at the UW.\n\nFor three decades, seismologist Lucy Jones soothed the nerves of quake-rattled Californians with her calm explanations and common-sense preparedness tips. Her frequent media appearances, including some with her toddler cradled on her hip, earned her a level of celebrity unprecedented among earthquake scientists since Charles Richter lent his name to the first earthquake scale.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been called the Beyonc\u00e9 of earthquakes, the Meryl Streep of government service, a woman breaking barriers in a man\u2019s world,\u201d the Los Angeles Times wrote in 2016 when Jones retired from the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nNow director of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Society, the pioneering researcher and communicator\u2019s latest mission is helping cities boost their ability to bounce back from natural disasters by applying science in a way that makes a difference.\n\nLucy Jones: \u2018Life Safety in the City: When There is More to Life Than Not Being Crushed\u2019 4:30 p.m. Monday, Alder Hall Auditorium, 1315 N.E.

The event is free, but online registration is required at: http://bit.ly/2Gzvp7d\n\nJones got a taste of what it takes to spark political action during a temporary stint as Los Angeles\u2019 earthquake \u201cczar.\u201d She helped create a gripping earthquake scenario to spell out what\u2019s at stake and worked with politicians, building owners and affordable-housing advocates to push through the nation\u2019s most aggressive seismic regulations requiring upgrades to dangerous buildings and other infrastructure.\n\nOn Monday, Jones will make her pitch for better quake preparedness in the Pacific Northwest at a free, public lecture at the University of Washington. In a Q&A with The Seattle Times (edited for clarity and brevity), she discussed topics ranging from our dread of earthquakes to why modern building codes aren\u2019t as great as most people think, and how scientists have bungled explanations of earthquake risk.\n\nQuestion: California has the country\u2019s highest earthquake risk, but Washington is second. What\u2019s your message for us?\n\nAnswer: You in many ways have a more challenging problem because you have fewer everyday earthquakes to bring the issue to public attention.\n\nThe concept of normalization bias (which causes people to underestimate the likelihood of a disaster and its effects) is a very strong thing in the human psyche. We\u2019re clearly evolved to focus on more immediate threats and we need stories, we need emotional connections to understand why we need to take action.\n\nEarthquakes are very difficult to plan for because of those reasons, especially if you don\u2019t remember the last time you had one. In very quiet times, it\u2019s very hard to get people engaged.\n\nFor a policymaker to decide it\u2019s worthwhile spending money on this when you have competing claims of homelessness and other problems, you need an emotional reason to connect and relate to your constituents and scientists don\u2019t understand that.\n\nQ: What\u2019s wrong with the way scientists communicate earthquake risk?\n\nA: As scientists, we explicitly refuse to use stories. One of the favorite lines is: The plural of anecdote is not data.\n\nWhen we did the ShakeOut scenario in California, we worked to make it a story, we made a movie out of it, the public fact sheet was written as a narrative.\n\nWe did not focus on probability. Talking about the probability of an earthquake in some time frame focuses on the part of the problem we don\u2019t know the answer to. When you talk about the uncertainty, people can find a reason to think it won\u2019t happen.\n\nWhen I\u2019m asked about the probability of an earthquake, I say \u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent. Just give me enough time.\u201d\n\nQ: How can you overcome denial and fatalism? The prospect of a magnitude 9 Cascadia megaquake and tsunami seems so overwhelming many folks just shrug and say: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d\n\nA: I think that\u2019s one of the most dangerous things that happens.\n\nEarthquakes are random, you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s coming and that makes it much more frightening. When you have too much fear, you don\u2019t do anything. That\u2019s been a mistake in how we sometimes message. We think we\u2019ve got to scare people. But that doesn\u2019t get them to act. They just want to hide from it.\n\nThe Cascadia 9 sounds much worse than the 8 in California, but the reality is it doesn\u2019t mean the shaking is going to be stronger. Your fault is offshore, so nobody is sitting on top of the fault.\n\nIt\u2019s not going to be any worse than what happened in Japan in 2011, and 150 people died in that earthquake. You can build to withstand earthquakes, period.\n\nAbout 18,000 people died in the tsunami, but they have way more people living in the tsunami zone than Oregon and Washington. If the Japan tsunami had been anything like a normal tsunami \u2014 it was about three times bigger than anyone thought was possible \u2014 they really would have had very few deaths.\n\nBut you cannot get only 150 dead here and keep your unreinforced masonry buildings.\n\nQ: Seattle doesn\u2019t require seismic retrofits for old brick buildings, also called unreinforced masonry. Los Angeles did it 30 years ago, and now is requiring upgrades to old concrete and soft-story buildings with weak ground floors. What does it take to get political action on seismic safety?\n\nA: The tradition is that it takes killing a lot of people. Most California laws were created because an earthquake killed people and that created the impetus. What\u2019s been so impressive about what\u2019s happening in Southern California now is the willingness to pass legislation without killing people first.\n\nA very large part of that is political leadership from (Los Angeles) Mayor (Eric) Garcetti. He recognized that we have a huge problem of affordable housing, and when the earthquake happens we\u2019re going to lose a huge amount of those older apartment buildings. Unless we want to make the problem 10 times worse, we have to prevent those apartments from being destroyed.\n\nWe also held lots of meetings with lots of stakeholders and laid out the consequences if we do nothing.\n\nThe arguments that brought people along were mainly economic, not lifesaving.\n\nQ: A lot of earthquake planning focuses on emergency response and personal preparedness. Why isn\u2019t that enough?\n\nA: Because that accepts damage is inevitable. When people ask me about earthquake prediction, I say: Do you want two hours to get out of a building, or do you want a building that doesn\u2019t fall down in the first place?\n\nWhy figure out how to survive not having water instead of fixing your water pipes so they don\u2019t break?\n\nIn L.A., we came up with a high-priority list, and the process is continuing.\n\nWe mandated that building owners had to pay for retrofitting their buildings, but the city is going to take on fixing the water system.\n\nAt the time, the only company in the world making seismically resilient pipes was in Japan. The city of L.A. went to American manufacturers and said: \u201cWe are only buying resilient pipe,\u201d and now there are cost-effective options out there.\n\nQ: Seattle is in the midst of a building boom. Won\u2019t all those new high-rises be fine after an earthquake?\n\nA: No. The current building code is a life-safety code. The goal is to not kill people. If you chose to have a building that\u2019s a total financial loss after the earthquake, that\u2019s your choice to make.\n\nI have a problem with that. The reality of an earthquake is that the failure of a building impacts the whole community.\n\nLook at what happened in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2011. No new buildings collapsed, but they had to tear down 1,800 buildings and they lost their downtown.\n\nI\u2019ve been working with state assemblymen to move California\u2019s building code up to a function recovery standard, so buildings could be repaired in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nWho knows if it will happen?

These factors mean that for the first time in six years Lloyd\u2019s is reporting a loss.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe world\u2019s oldest insurance market made a pretax loss of \u00a32bn last year, compared with a \u00a32.1bn profit the previous year. The group\u2019s combined ratio \u2013 a measure of claims and costs as a proportion of premiums \u2013 worsened from 98% to 114%.

Along with other executives, she did not receive a bonus payout under the Lloyd\u2019s performance plan last year because the LPP only pays out if the company makes an annual profit of more than \u00a3100m.\n\nLloyd\u2019s was one of the first UK businesses to publish its gender pay gap, revealing that women earn 32.1% less than men (for bonuses the gap is even bigger at 40.7%).\n\nBeale said she was \u201cnot proud of that at all\u201d and that Lloyd\u2019s was taking action, having signed up to the government\u2019s women in finance charter and introduced a back to work programme for parents. Its goal is to have women in 40% of its top management jobs in the next five years, up from 33.8% today.\n\nWomen were not allowed into the Lloyd\u2019s underwriting room until 1973, when Liliana Archibald became the first female broker there.\n\nLloyd\u2019s reiterated that its new office in Brussels would be up and running by July, ready to start writing business in January.

In October 2016, we revisited our study area by conducting two flights with a Hercules C-130 aircraft that collected aerial imagery (n = 7,298 single-frame mosaics) to better quantify the larger and rarer >50 cm plastic objects (Fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1 Field monitoring effort.

All trawls were designed to move away from the vessel to avoid wake effects on the capture efficiency of the devices. All vessel crews were trained with online material and one-to-one workshops that had been conducted prior to departure. While towing the trawl, the most experienced sailor aboard the vessel estimated the sea state (Beaufort scale) by measuring wind speeds and observing wave heights. This data was recorded in the standard datasheets provided, alongside the date, duration, as well as initial and final coordinates of each tow. The location and length of all net tows were confirmed during the post-processing phase by inspecting the position data from GPS trackers installed on all participating vessels. Most sampling stations encompassed a single net tow (n = 350 sampling stations) using a Manta trawl (0.5 mm square mesh, 90 cm \u00d7 15 cm mouth), which is one of the standard devices for quantifying plastic pollution levels. With the largest participating vessel (RV Ocean Starr), we simultaneously towed two Manta trawls, alongside two large Neuston trawls (1.5 cm square mesh, 6 m \u00d7 1.5 m mouth, of which 0.5 m above the water line; thereafter called \u2018Mega trawls\u2019) at every sampling location (n = 76 stations). After each Manta net tow, the net was rinsed from the outside with seawater, and its single-use cod-end removed, closed with staples and placed in an individual zip-lock bag. After each Mega trawl tow, the net was also rinsed from the outside with seawater and its large cod-end opened in a box filled with seawater. All buoyant plastics were then removed, wrapped in aluminium and placed in labelled plastic bags. The whole content captured by the Manta trawls was stored, while the organisms captured by the Mega trawls (mostly alive) were released back into the ocean. All samples were stored in a fridge or freezer while at-sea, and in a FedEx cool box (2\u20138 \u00b0C) or reefer (\u22122 \u00b0C) while being shipped to the laboratory. Even though we were careful when handling samples, some debris items may have been broken during transportation, leading to some bias in our debris size distribution. Detailed information related to these net tows (i.e. coordinates, metocean conditions, sampling times and durations) is provided in Figshare33.\n\nThe aerial surveys sampled a far greater area (311.0 km2) than the trawl surveys described above (3.9 km2 and 13.6 km2, for Manta and Mega net tows, respectively), thus yielding a more reliable quantification of debris larger than 50 cm, which are relatively rare. Both flights started and ended at Moffett Airfield near Mountain View, California. The first aerial survey was conducted on October 2nd 2016 sampling from 18:56 to 21:14 UTC time, at a constant latitude of 33.5\u00b0N, and longitudes varying from 141.4\u00b0W to 134.9\u00b0W. The second survey started on October 6th 2016 sampling from 22:14 to 0:37 UTC, from 30.1\u00b0N, 143.7\u00b0W to 32.9\u00b0N, 138.1\u00b0W. While in survey mode, the aircraft flew at an altitude of approximately 400 m and at a ground speed of 140 knots. Sampling transects targeted areas where the sea state conditions were the lowest, based on the weather forecast, including sea surface atmospheric pressure, cloud cover, wind speed at 10 m above sea level and boundary surface layer height provided by NOAA\u2019s Global Forecasting System, as well as significant wave height and peak period data distributed by NOAA\u2019s WaveWatch3 model outputs. Even though we surveyed floating debris using trained observers and three types of sensor (Lidar, SWIR imager, and RGB camera), here we only analyse information coming from the geo-referenced mosaics produced by a RGB camera (CS-4800i) that generally took photographs every second during surveying time (frame size = ~360 m across track, ~240 m along track, ~0.1 m resolution).\n\nTrawl samples processing\n\nTrawl samples were separately washed into a sieve tower (five Glenammer Engineering Ltd sieves, with 0.05 cm, 0.15 cm, 0.5 cm, 1.5 cm, and 5 cm square apertures) that divided the material into the following size classes: 0.05\u20130.15 cm, 0.15\u20130.5 cm, 0.5\u20131.5 cm, 1.5\u20135 cm, and >5 cm. Debris items >5 cm were then manually sorted into 5\u201310 cm, 10\u201350 cm, and >50 cm classes by measuring the object lengths (widest dimension of the object) with a ruler. Buoyant debris was separated from biomass by placing the material within each sieve in filtered saltwater (salinity 3.5%, temperature 19\u201323 \u00b0C). Lab personnel stirred the material many times to insure floating particles were detached from the biomass material. Floating objects identified as buoyant debris were manually extracted from the water surface using forceps, separated into types, and counted. Buoyant debris was classified into material type (plastic, glass, paraffin, tar, rubber, wood, pumice, seed or unknown), with plastics being further divided into the following categories: (1) \u2018H\u2019 type \u2013 fragments and objects made of hard plastic, plastic sheet or film; (2) \u2018N\u2019 type \u2013 plastic lines, ropes, and fishing nets; (3) \u2018P\u2019 type \u2013 pre-production plastic pellets in the shape of a cylinder, disk or sphere; and (4) \u2018F\u2019 type \u2013 fragments or objects made of foamed material (e.g. expanded polystyrene). Once counted and categorized, the pieces were washed with distilled water, transferred to aluminium dishes, dried overnight at 60 \u00b0C, and weighed using an OHAUS Explorer EX324M (0.0001 g readability) for objects <5 cm, and a OHAUS Explorer EX12001M (0.1 g readability) for objects >5 cm.\n\nTo best characterize the ocean plastic accumulating within the GPGP, we performed additional analyses with the material collected. Firstly, 10 pieces within each plastic size/type category (n = 220 pieces) were selected for polymer composition analysis by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The readings were done using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR equipped with a universal ATR accessory (range = 600\u20134000 cm\u22121). The respective polymer type was determined by comparing sample FT-IR spectra against known spectra from a database (Perkin-Elmer ATR of Polymers Library). Secondly, we screened all plastic debris collected for production dates, as well as any writings statements giving information on its origin (i.e. language and \u2018made in\u2019 statements). Lastly, we classified plastic items from \u2018H\u2019 and \u2018L\u2019 types collected at 30 RV Ocean Starr stations into object types (e.g. bottle lids, bags, bottles, etc). As \u2018H\u2019 objects larger than 50 cm were relatively rare, we analysed 10 extra RV Ocean Starr stations for this type/size category. If the object type of a fragment could not be determined, we classified the piece as either hard plastic fragment or film fragment depending on its wall thickness and flexibility34. We used Manta trawl samples to characterise objects within size classes 0.15\u20130.5 cm, 0.5\u20131.5 cm, and 1.5\u20135 cm, and Mega trawl samples to characterise objects within size classes 5\u201310 cm, 10\u201350 cm, and >50 cm. Plastics within our smallest size class (0.05\u20130.15 cm) were not considered in this \u2018Object Type\u2019 analysis due to the difficulty of handling and identifying small fragments.\n\nThe numerical/mass concentrations of buoyant plastic items (count/kg of plastic per km2 of sea surface) measured by each net tow were calculated for all plastic size/type categories separately. To do so, we divided the count and weight of plastic objects within each category by the towed area of the sample. We calculated the towed area by multiplying net mouth width (90 cm for Manta trawl, 6 m for Mega trawl) by tow length (determined from GPS position data). The average area covered by Manta net tows was 0.008 km2 (SD = 0.004, min\u2013max: 0.001\u20130.018 km2), while the average area covered by Mega net tows was 0.090 km2, (SD = 0.013, min\u2013max: 0.046\u20130.125 km2). As buoyant plastics can be missed by surface trawls due to wind-driven mixing, we then estimated the \u2018depth-integrated\u2019 mass and numerical plastic concentrations (Ci) for all type/size categories at each of the trawl sampling locations using the equations described in ref.35. Supplementary Methods 1 provides details on how Ci was calculated as a function of ocean plastic terminal rising velocity (Wb), depth sampled by the trawl, and sea state. It also describes how we measured Wb for each of the type/size categories of this study. After comparing plastic concentration results obtained by paired Manta and Mega net tows (n = 76 locations), we decided to use Manta and Mega trawl samples to quantify debris 0.05\u20135 cm and 5\u201350 cm in size, respectively. The comparison results and reasoning behind such decision in provided in Supplementary Methods 2.\n\nAerial imagery processing\n\nAll RGB images taken during our survey flights (n = 7,298) were georeferenced using accurate aircraft position and altitude data collected during the surveys. They were then inspected by two trained observers and a detection algorithm. Observers inspected all images at full-screen on a Samsung HD monitor (LU28E590DS/XY) and those single-frame mosaics containing debris were uploaded into QGIS software (Version 2.18.3\u2013Las Palmas) to record their position and characteristics. We trust we had a very small number of false positives and a high number of false negatives. This is because the observers took a conservative approach: they only logged features as debris when they were very confident with its identification. As such, many features that could be debris, but resembled other natural features, such as sun glint and breaking wave, were not logged into our ocean plastic dataset. Once this work was finalised, we ran an experimental algorithm capable of detecting potential debris in all our RGB mosaics as a quality control step. To avoid any false positives, all features detected by the algorithm were also visually inspected by an observer and only those visually identified as debris were logged in our QGIS database. For every sighting, we recorded position (latitude, longitude), length (widest dimension of the object), width, and object type: (1) \u2018bundled net\u2019 \u2013 a group of fishing nets bundled tightly together; they are commonly colourful and of a rounded shape; (2) \u2018loose net\u2019 \u2013 a single fishing net; they were generally quite translucent and rectangular in shape; (3) \u2018container\u2019 \u2013 rectangular and bright objects, such as fishing crates and drums; (4) \u2018rope\u2019 \u2013 long cylindrical objects around 15 cm thick; (5) \u2018buoy/lid\u2019, rounded bright objects that could be either a large lid or a buoy; (6) \u2018unknown\u2019 \u2013 objects that are clearly debris but whose object type was not identified, they were mostly irregular-shaped items resembling plastic fragments; and (7) Other \u2013 only one object was successfully identified but did not belong to any category above: a life ring. We recorded 1,595 debris items (403 and 1,192 in flights 1 and 2 respectively); 626 were 10\u201350 cm and 969 were >50 cm in length. Most of them were classified as \u2018unknown\u2019 (78% for 10\u201350 cm, 32% for >50 cm), followed by \u2018buoy or lid\u2019 (20%) and \u2018bundled net\u2019 (1%) for 10\u201350 cm debris, and by \u2018bundled net\u2019 (29%), \u2018container\u2019 (18%), \u2018buoy or lid\u2019 (9%), \u2018rope\u2019 (6%), and \u2018lose net\u2019 (4%) for >50 cm debris. To calculate ocean plastic concentrations, we grouped the geo-referenced images into 31 ~10 km2 mosaics. For numerical concentrations, we simply divided the number of debris pieces 10\u201350 cm and >50 cm within each mosaic by the area covered. To estimate mass concentrations, we had to first estimate the mass of each object spotted, then we separately summed the mass of 10\u201350 cm and >50 cm debris within each mosaic by the area covered. More information on how we estimated the mass of each spotted objects is provided in Supplementary Methods 3.\n\nNumerical model formulation\n\nOcean plastic pathways can be represented by Lagrangian particle trajectories31. In our framework, particles were advected by the following environmental drivers: sea surface currents, wave induced Stokes drift and winds. Starting from identical particle releases, we produced a series of forcing scenarios to represent the diversity in shape and composition of ocean plastics. Starting from using sea surface current only, we gradually added forcing terms representing the actions of atmospheric drag and wind waves on buoyant debris. The action of wind was simulated by considering the displacement of particles as a fraction of wind speed at 10 m above sea level. This is referred as the \u2018windage coefficient\u2019. We assessed different windage coefficient scenarios including 0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 2% and 3%. We sourced global sea surface currents (1993 to 2012) from the HYCOM + NCODA global 1/12\u00b0 reanalysis (experiment 19.0 and 19.136,37,38), and wind (10 m above sea level) speed and direction data (1993 to 2012) from NCEP/NCAR global reanalysis39. Wave induced Stokes drift amplitude was calculated using wave spectrum bulk coefficients (significant wave height, peak wave period and direction) from Wavewatch3 model outputs40.\n\nFor every forcing scenario, particles were identically and continuously released in time from 1993 to 2012 following spatial distributions and amplitudes of significant ocean plastic sources on land (coastal population hotspots23 and major rivers24) as well as at sea (fishing26,41, aquaculture42 and shipping industries43). Source scenarios were combined using relative source contribution as well as geographical distribution presented in Supplementary Methods 4. We advected global particles in time using the forcing scenarios described above and successfully reproduced the formation of oceanic garbage patches, with the shape and gradient of particle concentrations in these areas differing amongst forcing scenarios. We computed daily particle visits over 0.2\u00b0 resolution grids corresponding to our observation domain and extending from 160\u00b0W to 120\u00b0W in longitude and 20\u00b0N to 45\u00b0N in latitude. The number of daily particle visits was uniformized over the total number of particles present in the global model at a given time. The model-predicted non-dimensional concentration \u03b4 i of cell i, was calculated as follows:\n\n\u03b4 i = \u2211 s \u03b1 s \u03b4 i , s (1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 s is the non-dimensional weight relative to the contribution of source s and \u03b4 i,s is the percentage of global particles from source s in cell i. \u03b4 i,s is calculated with the number of particles n i,s from source s in cell i over the total number of global particles \u03a3 i n s from source s:\n\n\u03b4 i , s = n i , s \u2211 i n s (2)\n\nNumerical model calibration\n\nWe collected measurements at sea in 2015 and 2016, but our numerical model uses ocean circulation reanalysis covering the period from 1993 to 2012. Modelled ocean circulation data post-2012 is available from HYCOM however not as a reanalysis product. As such, we decided not to use it in this study. As initial model particles released in 1993 significantly start to accumulate in the area after about 7 years, we averaged uniformized daily particle visits over 12 years, from 2000 to 2012. We grouped observed debris size classes in four categories: microplastics (0.05\u20130.5 cm), mesoplastics (0.5\u20135 cm), macroplastics (5\u201350 cm) and megaplastics (>50 cm). We compared model predictions against depth-integrated microplastic concentrations as this dataset collected by Manta trawls had the largest spatial coverage. Mass concentrations derived from trawl measurements were grouped in 0.2-degree resolution cells and compared against model-predicted non-dimensional concentration \u03b4 for the five different forcing scenarios. The best model fit was found for the forcing scenario with sea-surface current only (R2 = 0.52, n = 277 cells). The regression coefficient declined as we increased the atmospheric drag term (R2 = 0.39 to 0.21 depending on windage coefficient).\n\nAs we analysed the accumulation of model particles in the GPGP region, we noticed significant seasonal and inter-annual variations of the GPGP position. The modelled GPGP dimensions was relatively consistent throughout our 12 years of analysis, but the relative position of this accumulation zone varied with years and seasons. We first decided to test our model for seasonal variation by comparing our microplastic concentrations (measured in July \u2013 September 2015) against modelled concentrations averages for the July\u2013September periods of 2000 to 2012. This comparison yielded poorer results (R2 = 0.46 to 0.21, depending on forcing scenario) than with the 12 years average solution (R2 = 0.52) as the July\u2013September GPGP position varied substantially among years.\n\nThe relation between the accumulation of marine debris in the North Pacific and climate events such as El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has previously been discussed18. As such, to account for inter-annual variation, we compared latitudinal and longitudinal position of the GPGP against these two climate indexes: ENSO and PDO. We found that 2002 and 2004 were similar to the conditions experienced during our multi-vessel expedition. Thus, we compared our measurements against particle visit averages for July\u2013September of 2002 and 2004 combined. This second attempt exhibited better results (R2 = 0.58 to 0.41, depending on forcing scenario), suggesting that climatic events such as ENSO or PDO influence the average position of the GPGP. Therefore, we decided to use the July\u2013September average for 2002 and 2004, which better accounts for inter-annual variations in the GPGP position. More information on the selection of years for calibrating the model against trawl and aerial surveys data is provided in Supplementary Methods 5. The best fit between model predictions and microplastic observations was found once again for the forcing scenario with sea surface current only (R2 = 0.58, n = 277). The best regression fit between measured and modelled microplastic concentrations had a = \u22128.3068 and b = 0.6770 in the parametric formulation:\n\nc m o d = 10 log 10 \u03b4 \u2212 a b (3)\n\nFrom this formulation, we computed the modelled microplastics mass concentration in our domain area and extracted contour levels by order of magnitude, from 0.01 g km\u22122 to 10 kg km\u22122. The GPGP as defined in this study corresponds to the 1 kg km\u22122 microplastic mass concentration level covering an area of 1.6 million km2 and depicted as a bold line in Fig. 2a. As a validation, we categorized microplastics measurements inside and outside the 1 kg km\u22122 contour line (Fig. 2b). For stations inside the model-predicted GPGP, the median measured microplastic concentration was 1.8 kg km\u22122 (25th\u201375th percentiles = 3.5\u20130.9 kg km\u22122) while for stations outside, the median was 0.3 kg km\u22122 (25th\u201375th percentiles = 0.2\u20130.7 kg km\u22122). Using our calibrated microplastics distribution, we computed the mass and numerical concentration for individual size classes from scaling modelled concentrations by the ratio between average modelled microplastics distribution inside the GPGP and averaged measured concentrations per size class of stations inside the patch. A comparison between measured and modelled mass/numerical concentrations for all ocean plastic size classes is given in Fig. 2c and d.\n\nFigure 2 Numerical model calibration. (a) The GPGP boundary (blue line) is estimated by comparing microplastic concentration measurements (circles) to model particle visit averages that accounted for seasonal and inter-annual variations. This map was created using QGIS version 2.18.1 (www.qgis.org). (b) Model validation showing median measured mass concentration for microplastics of stations outside and inside our predicted 1 kg km\u22122 GPGP boundary. Bars extend from 25th to 75th percentile while whiskers extend to minimum and maximum non-outlier. Outliers are represented as crosses. (c) Measured mass concentrations versus modelled mass concentrations for microplastics, mesoplastics, macroplastics and megaplastics. (d) Same as (c) but with numerical concentrations. Full size image\n\nOur confidence intervals were formulated to account for uncertainties in both sampling and modelling. For the trawl collection (i.e. micro-, meso- and macroplastics), we considered uncertainties related to the vertical-mixing corrections applied to surface concentrations using reported sea state and plastic\u2019s rising velocities (see Supplementary Methods 1). For the aerial mosaics, we accounted for uncertainties related to estimating the mass of sighted objects based on correlations between top-view area and dry weight of objects collected in the trawls (see Supplementary Methods 3). Finally, to account for modelling uncertainties, we added (respectively subtracted) the standard error of measured concentration to (resp. from) the mean upper (resp. lower) mass concentration when scaling the microplastics distribution to individual size classes.\n\nCharacterisation by types, sources and forcing scenarios\n\nThe total estimated mass load of ocean plastic in the GPGP by size classes were further divided by types. We calculated the average fraction in mass of individual ocean plastic types per sampling event for stations inside the patch (Supplementary Table 1) and derived the contribution of types \u2018H\u2019, \u2018N\u2019, \u2018F\u2019 and \u2018P\u2019. Further, as we predominantly observed debris originated from marine sources, we investigated the source contribution predicted by our calibrated modelled distribution. For individual model cells, we calculated the percentage of Lagrangian particle visits from individual sources. As initial particles were weighted in accordance to estimated global inputs, model particles from marine sources originally represented 28.1% of the total amount of material with fishing (17.9%), aquaculture (1.3%) and shipping (8.9%). We calculated the difference from this initial percentage value for each model cell and reported it to the predicted total mass concentration. In doing so, we defined \u2018anomalies\u2019 in marine source contribution in the North Pacific and expressed these in unit of mass per surface area. Finally, even though our calibrated model considered sea surface current only, we compared the predominance of forcing scenarios by evaluating the respective number of particle visits for each model cells. We computed contours around the GPGP for individual forcing scenarios in a way that the material contained inside each contour is equal to our initial forcing scenario (i.e. sea surface current only).\n\nThe dependence of the particle trajectory on the windage coefficient predicted by our model is in good agreement with sightings and modelling of debris originated from the 2011 Tohoku tsunami in Japan44,45. The first identified Japanese debris items that arrived after 10 to 12 months on the North American shores were objects with high windage such as buoys, boats and floating docks. Debris also arrived on Hawaiian Islands 18 months after the incident. The time of arrival was closely related to object types, starting in the first year with large oyster farm buoys and other floats, containers, and canisters. In the second year more buoys, tipped boats, fridges, and pallets arrived, followed later by timber beams and wooden debris. Our model predicted that only objects with a windage coefficient above 3% could arrive on Hawaii in the second year after the 2011 tsunami. Objects with windage coefficient ranging from 1 to 2% would reach Hawaii during the third year, while objects with no windage would mostly accumulate in the GPGP, north east of the archipelago.\n\nLong term analysis\n\nThe definition of a dynamic GPGP boundary that accounts for seasonal and inter-annual variabilities allowed us to estimate which sea surface trawl data points from the literature are inside or outside the GPGP region. Therefore, we used our calibrated model to assess the decadal evolution of microplastic mass concentrations (kg km\u22122) within and around the GPGP. Concentration data from the literature (Supplementary Table 2) was obtained from published datasets or digitized from figures when not available digitally17,46,47. When data was reported in unit of mass per volume of water48, we used the net tow depth to calculate the concentration per surface area unit. When only numerical concentration was reported22,48, we estimated mass concentration by using the average ocean plastic mass from net tows where both mass and numerical concentrations were reported (m = 3.53 mg, SE: 0.10 mg, n = 872).\n\nWe compared the model-predicted GPGP boundary with the locations of samples collected between 1999 and 201221,22,48,49. Samples collected before 199917,46,47,48 were compared against the GPGP position estimated for the sampled months and years in the 1999\u20132012 period that had similar ENSO and PDO values (See Supplementary Methods 6). Using our dynamic GPGP model boundary as reference, we classified each net tow into 3 categories: (1) sampled within the GPGP boundary, (2) sampled outside the GPGP boundary, but above 20\u00b0N and below 45\u00b0N and (3) sampled in the rest of the North Pacific. We only used net tows from the first two categories above so that concentration statistics for outside the patch were not biased by measurements taken in equatorial and polar waters, where concentrations were very low. We then grouped these microplastic concentration observations from plankton net trawls by decades, taking data recorded between 1965\u20131974 (n = 20 inside and n = 58 outside17,48), 1975\u20131984 (n = 0 inside and n = 19 outside46), 1985\u20131994 (n = 4 inside and n = 2 outside47), 1995\u20132004 (n = 2 inside and n = 252 outside22,49), 2005\u20132014 (n = 195 inside and n = 861 outside21,22,48) and finally 2015 (n = 288 inside and n = 213 outside; this study). We calculated the mean (\u00b1 standard error) of measured microplastic mass concentration per decades for within and around the GPGP boundary. Finally, we extracted decadal trends by fitting an exponential function (R2 = 0.94) assuming null concentrations at the beginning of the 20th century. The exponential fit exhibited better results than linear, quadratic or cubic functions (R2 = 0.71, R2 = 0.86 and R2 = 0.91, respectively).", "title": "Evidence that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is rapidly accumulating plastic"}, {"url": "https://www.theoceancleanup.com/press/great-pacific-garbage-patch-growing-rapidly-study-shows/", "content": "This site makes use of third-party cookies for analytics.

(Photo: The Ocean Cleanup)\n\nThe world's largest collection of ocean garbage is growing.\n\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a collection of plastic, floating trash halfway between Hawaii and California, has grown to more than 600,000 square miles, a study published Thursday found. That's twice the size of Texas.\n\nWinds and converging ocean currents funnel the garbage into a central location, said study lead author Laurent Lebreton of the Ocean Cleanup Foundation, a non-profit organization that spearheaded the research.\n\nFirst discovered in the early 1990s, the trash in the patch comes from around the Pacific Rim, including nations in Asia and North and South America, Lebreton said.\n\nThe patch is not a solid mass of plastic. It includes about 1.8 trillion pieces and weighs 88,000 tons \u2014 the equivalent of 500 jumbo jets. The new figures are as much as 16 times higher than previous estimates.\n\nThe research \u2014 the most complete study undertaken of the garbage patch \u2014 was published Thursday in the peer-reviewed journal Scientific Reports.\n\n\"We were surprised by the amount of large plastic objects we encountered,\u201d said Julia Reisser of the foundation. \u201cWe used to think most of the debris consists of small fragments, but this new analysis shines a new light on the scope of the debris.\"\n\nThe study was based on a three-year mapping effort by an international team of scientists affiliated with the Ocean Cleanup Foundation, six universities and an aerial sensor company.\n\nMore: Our trash harms the deepest fish in the ocean\n\nMore: Humans have produced 18.2 trillion pounds of plastic since the '50s. That's equal in size to 1 billion elephants.\n\nSadly, the Pacific patch isn't alone. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is the largest of five such trash collections in the ocean, Lebreton said.\n\nCLOSE This video shows the devastating plastic waste that is overtaking the waters near Bali. Buzz60\n\nScientists work with the European Space Agency to take photos of the garbage patches from space.\n\nNo governments have stepped up to clean the trash, which is in international waters, so it's up to privately funded groups such as the Ocean Cleanup Foundation to take the lead in getting rid of the garbage.\n\nThere's a sense of urgency, said Joost Dubois, a spokesman with the foundation.\n\n\"It's a ticking time bomb of larger material,\" Dubois said. \"We've got to get it before it breaks down into a size that's too small to collect and also dangerous for marine life.\"\n\nSince plastic has been around only since the 1950s, there's no way of knowing exactly how long it will last in the ocean. If left alone, the plastic could remain there for decades, centuries or even longer.\n\n\"Unless we begin to remove it, some would say it may remain there forever,\" Lebreton said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2GeRHO8", "title": "Pacific garbage patch, largest collection of ocean trash, grows"}, {"url": "://story/dgoxP3Ls0mOzuiM?ned=us", "content": "", "title": ""}, {"url": "http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/mar/08/after-a-self-imposed-hiatus-seattles-bryan-john-ap/", "content": "Seattle singer/songwriter Bryan John Appleby\u2019s most recent tweet was posted Feb. 21, 2017.\n\nIn it, he praises an essay by writer Ijeoma Oluo called \u201cWhite People: I Don\u2019t Want You to Understand Me Better, I Want You to Understand Yourselves.\u201d\n\nHe was a little more active on Facebook last year, posting sporadically about small tours and one-off shows.\n\nAfter taking a bit of a self-imposed hiatus from his own music in 2017, Appleby is getting back into the swing of things with a handful of headlining gigs, including a stop at the Bartlett on Friday.\n\nAppleby\u2019s hiatus came a year after the release of his sophomore album \u201cThe Narrow Valley,\u201d a concept album that begins with an earthquake hitting a small California town and goes onto explore moments in the lives of the townspeople before the earthquake hit.\n\nIt\u2019s a sweeping orchestral pop record with a story brought to life through Appleby\u2019s cinematic lyrics.\n\n\u201cThe Fault Line cracked a long smile/A hideous rock-tooth grin open wide/\u2026A broken bedside vase, then our books flew from their case/And the walls began to shed their plaster hides,\u201d Appleby sings on the opening track \u201cThe Fault Line.\u201d\n\nAs a songwriter, Appleby has always looked to visual arts for inspiration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m finding just as much to get excited about in watching movies or reading really descriptive literature as I am in finding ideas in other people\u2019s music,\u201d he said. \u201cMusical inspiration is definitely just one brick in the wall of inspiration. It\u2019s not necessarily even the cornerstone.\u201d\n\nThe first half of 2016 found Appleby and his band touring in support of the album. But after the initial bout of promotion passed and funds began to dwindle, Appleby made the decision to begin touring solo.\n\nAppleby can see himself putting together a band for a show or two here and there, but for the time being, he\u2019s enjoying the freedom performing solo has afforded him.\n\n\u201cThat shift in emphasis definitely gave me moments of freedom and a little bit more air as far as not having restraints or needing to make things work on a large scale for a whole team of folks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m no longer carrying all of that weight and therefore can re-examine my relationship to all sorts of things but specifically reexamine my relationship to the industry and the album cycle and all the built in, baked in expectations of turnaround time.\u201d\n\nWith a new leisurely approach to performing and the music industry, Appleby decided to switch gears from the guitar to the drums, the first instrument he learned to play.\n\nHe backed friend Garett van der Spek, who performs as Prism Tats, for what was supposed to be one show but ended up performing nearly two dozen shows with him last year.\n\nHe also played guitar with Seattle\u2019s Tomten.\n\nAppleby saw his time out of the spotlight as a chance for his well of inspiration to fill up again, though he also used it as a chance to step back at a time when another man was doing plenty of talking.\n\n\u201cMy narrative and my experience, I didn\u2019t feel like exploring that publicly in a moment when all of a sudden there\u2019s a really loud white guy in charge of everything in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just felt like a better year to be listening than it did to be declaring things.\u201d\n\nAfter a year of listening and with a well of inspiration filled with \u201chundreds of 42-second voice memos from the last two years,\u201d Appleby has once again picked up the guitar and is in the process of writing new music.\n\nWhile he\u2019s grateful for the work of producers Sam Anderson, on \u201cThe Narrow Valley,\u201d and Kevin Watley, on 2011\u2019s \u201cFire on the Vine,\u201d and he\u2019s proud of the \u201ccinematic, layered, lush\u201d feel of \u201cThe Narrow Valley,\u201d Appleby doesn\u2019t think his next two or three records will be as expansive.\n\nFor one thing, he doesn\u2019t want to go into debt to release an album, as he\u2019s still paying off the debt from \u201cThe Narrow Valley.\u201d\n\nBut he\u2019s also curious to see the kind of music he can make when, as he put it, he doesn\u2019t have bells and whistles to rely on.\n\n\u201cWhat is the kernel of an idea? What\u2019s the thing that really is good here?\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on polishing that rather than paying a bunch of people to make it sound really, really cool.\u201d\n\nAnd, as silly as it sounds, Appleby is looking forward to finding out, more than 10 years into his career, what he sounds like.\n\nHe said though \u201cThe Narrow Valley\u201d and \u201cFire on the Vine\u201d were released under his name, the albums were fairly collaborative efforts with Anderson and Watley, with 50 percent, the lyrics, chords and melodies, coming from Appleby and the other 50 percent, the character of the sound and how the albums were voiced, coming from the producers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing I\u2019m excited to explore,\u201d he said. \u201cFor better or for worse, what does it sound like when it\u2019s 90 percent me with a few friends here and there rather than these grand gestures with a producer?\u201d", "title": "After a self-imposed hiatus, Seattle\u2019s Bryan John Appleby returns to center stage"}, {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02784-7", "content": "The eruption of Mount St Helens in 1980 caused the deaths of 57 people.Credit: KPA/Zuma/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe world needs to do more to prepare for the next huge volcanic eruption, a team of leading scientists says.\n\nThe devastating Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 and the T\u014dhoku earthquake in Japan in 2011 highlighted some of the worst-case scenarios for natural disasters. But humanity has not had to deal with a cataclysmic volcanic disaster since at least 1815, when the eruption of Tambora in Indonesia killed tens of thousands of people and led to a \u2018year without a summer\u2019 in Europe and North America. Such world-altering blasts rank at 7 or more on the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) scale of eruptions, which goes to 8.\n\n\u201cThe next VEI-7 eruption could occur within our lifetimes, or it could be hundreds of years down the road,\u201d says Chris Newhall, a volcanologist with the Mirisbiris Garden and Nature Center in Santo Domingo, Philippines. But the time to have this discussion is now, he says, so that researchers and government officials can plan and prepare before an emergency strikes.\n\nNewhall is the lead author of a paper published last week in Geosphere1 that explores the potential consequences of the next VEI-7 eruption. His co-authors are volcanologist Stephen Self of the University of California, Berkeley \u2014 with whom Newhall devised the VEI scale2 in 1982 \u2014 and Alan Robock, a climate scientist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. All three have researched the VEI-5 eruption of Mount St Helens in Washington state in 1980, and the VEI-6 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991.\n\nThose events killed dozens to hundreds of people and disrupted entire regions. Pinatubo even spewed enough sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to cause global cooling. But a VEI-7 eruption would be of an entirely different scale. In 1257, a VEI-7 eruption in what is now Indonesia probably cooled the planet down enough to kick off a centuries-long cold snap called the Little Ice Age, Robock says. \u201cThese things are hugely important for the planet, but the next one will take place in quite a different environment,\u201d he adds.\n\nA globalized world\n\nAgriculture, health care, financial systems and other aspects of modern life are much more globally interconnected than they were just a few decades ago, the scientists say. Eight years ago, an eruption that ranked at just VEI 3 \u2014 Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull, in Iceland \u2014 grounded European air traffic for days because of the danger of flying through volcanic ash. The event caused an estimated US$5 billion in economic losses.\n\nNewhall\u2019s team says that researchers should start to prepare for a VEI-7 eruption by studying potential effects on crucial communications links \u2014 such as how atmospheric moisture and volcanic ash can interfere with global positioning system signals. Others could work to improve their understanding of how large amounts of magma accumulate and erupt, helping scientists to forecast where the next VEI-7 event might occur.\n\nThe researchers already have a long list of candidate volcanoes that might be capable of a VEI-7 blast. They include Taupo in New Zealand, site of the world\u2019s last VEI-8 eruption \u2014 26,500 years ago \u2014 and Iran\u2019s Mount Damavand, which lies just 50 kilometres from Tehran.\n\nPreparing for rare but deadly eruptions is as important as dealing with smaller, more-frequent ones, says Janine Krippner, a volcanologist at Concord University in Athens, West Virginia. \u201cEven with the lower probability of these larger events, when they do occur people will look to scientists, emergency managers, governments and other entities and expect them to be prepared,\u201d she says. \u201cWe owe it to our communities to be researching potentially devastating eruptions, so we can guide people on what to do.\u201d", "title": "Volcanologists warn world is unprepared for next major eruption"}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2018/03/photos-of-the-week-the-sydney-skinny-a-glacial-arch-pelicans-at-play/555797/", "content": "Skijoring in Montana, a Russian presidential candidate in Moscow, economic disparity in Manila, a walkout against gun violence across the United States, civilians fleeing the battlefields of Syria, ski mountaineering in France, a balloon designer in Australia, the stark and lonely route of a German volunteer mailman in Schleswig-Holstein, and much more.", "title": "Photos of the Week: the Sydney Skinny, a Glacial Arch, Pelicans at Play"}, {"url": "http://wamc.org/post/blair-horner-fukushima-anniversary-and-ny-s-subsidies-nuclear-power", "content": "Last weekend was the seventh anniversary of the disaster at the Japanese nuclear power plant located in Fukushima. On March 11, 2011, an earthquake occurred in the Pacific Ocean that spawned a huge tsunami. The quake itself caused considerable damage to the Japanese islands near the center of the quake, but the tsunami\u2019s impact was catastrophic.\n\nThe waves caused by the earthquake hit the Fukushima area with such force that over one million buildings were partially or completely destroyed and about 19,000 residents were killed.\n\nAt the same time, eleven reactors at four nuclear power plants in the region were forced to shut down. However, the tsunami disabled the emergency generators that would have provided power to control and operate the pumps necessary to cool the superheated reactors. The insufficient cooling led to three nuclear meltdowns, hydrogen-air explosions, and the release of radioactive material during the next few days after the tsunami hit.\n\nThe result of this disaster forced tens of thousands of Japanese to relocate from the area and the uncontrolled release of radioactive materials into the area and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe power plants in Fukushima are of the same design as some in New York State, which are located on Lake Ontario. While no one would expect the same scenario to occur, those plants have been the focus of state policies in recent years.\n\nThe plants, built in the 1960s, have exceeded their expected useful lifetimes. Generally, plants of that design and era are expected to be used for roughly 40 or so years. Yet those plants continue to operate under a deal negotiated largely outside of public view.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, negotiators from the Cuomo Administration and the plant owners agreed to a multi-billion dollar bailout of the plants \u2013 which were slated for closure. At that time, the state did not reveal the estimated costs, but subsequent analyses estimated that the costs could run anywhere from $2.9 billion to $7.6 billion over a 12-year period. The negotiation contained no new safety requirements for the plants, just a guarantee that virtually all New Yorkers would be required to pay to make the nuke plants profitable \u2013 whether they received power from the plants or not \u2013 to keep them open.\n\nThe safety records of the plants came under new scrutiny in a report issued last week by the Alliance for a Green Economy, an upstate New York nuclear watchdog organization. The report analyzed recent inspection reports and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) documents and identified three issues of concern:\n\nThe group identified regulatory violations without penalties: 18 violations of Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were reported between March 2017 and February 2018 for the four Upstate reactors, but no penalties or fines were assessed.\n\nThe group identified examples of weakened regulations at the request of nuclear operators. For example, at the request of one of the plant\u2019s owners, the National Regulatory Commission changed the requirement for what constitutes an \u201cunusual event\u201d regarding Lake Ontario flooding. As we all know, there had been extensive flooding last year in the Lake Ontario area.\n\nLastly, the group identified missed deadlines for fixing known safety and maintenance issues: one plant near Oswego does not have a containment vessel likely to be able to contain the pressure and radiation released by a meltdown and installation of a required vent has been delayed; the plant\u2019s owner is behind schedule for fixing numerous maintenance issues.\n\nNew York State should learn the lessons of the dangers of relying on nuclear power and follow the path set by California: move to shut down these aging facilities, and instead move toward greater reliance on solar, wind and geothermal power. Those power generators have been starved of adequate support since so much of the state\u2019s wealth is tied up in propping up the Lake Ontario plants. New York energy efficiency programs are anemic and lag far behind neighboring states and currently solar only generates about 1 percent of the power for the state. Instead of mandating that New Yorkers subsidize aging, inefficient, 20th century nuclear plants, that money should be redirected to 21st century conservation and renewable energy programs.\n\nBlair Horner is executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group.\n\nThe views expressed by commentators are solely those of the authors.

Photos by Thinkstock and YouTube.\n\nAlmost since its founding, Twitter has regarded itself as a platform for news; watershed moments in the company\u2019s history included the Arab Spring and a 2011 East Coast earthquake. Facebook began talking as early as 2013 about wanting to be a sort of \u201cpersonalized newspaper,\u201d only to realize more recently that separating real news from propaganda was harder than it had anticipated. Both companies have spent much of the past year reckoning with their roles in spreading hoaxes, facilitating election interference, and fueling societal division and extremism.\n\nGoogle\u2019s YouTube, in contrast, has until recently managed to skirt the brunt of the criticism that rival social media platforms have faced. As a result, it has been relatively slow to grapple with the implications of its role as a source of news\u2014and, inevitably, of misinformation. As recently as October, in a series of congressional hearings, Google downplayed the significance of its video platform in Russian election interference, while Facebook and Twitter fielded the toughest questions.\n\nNow a series of controversies is forcing YouTube to address its responsibilities more directly and candidly than it has in the past. At the South by Southwest Interactive conference this week in Austin, Texas, an appearance by YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki made it clear that the platform is finally giving serious thought to the quality and veracity of information its users are getting. It also made clear that the company has a lot of catching up to do.\n\nIn January, star YouTube vlogger Logan Paul sparked a backlash when he published a video showing the dead body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan. Google responded by canceling Paul\u2019s \u201cpreferred\u201d ad deal and suspending his projects for its premium video service, YouTube Red. That came as the company was already dealing with a series of reports revealing disturbing cartoons apparently aimed at kids (it subsequently deleted 150,000 of them) and another genre of videos depicting children in abusive situations. The latter prompted the company to hire thousands more human moderators to review content for potential policy violations.\n\nBut it has since become obvious that YouTube\u2019s problems aren\u2019t simply a matter of manpower. They flow from the company\u2019s confusion about the nature of its business and the extent of its responsibilities.\n\n.@SusanWojcicki \"If there is an important news event we want to be delivering the right information.\"\n\n\n\nMinutes later she says, \"We are not a news organization.\" \u2014 Ryan Mac (@RMac18) March 13, 2018\n\nIn February, YouTube\u2019s algorithms boosted conspiracy videos attacking the children who survived the Parkland, Florida, school massacre. This month, influential YouTube conspiracy theorist Alex Jones claimed the company was about to delete his channel, a claim YouTube said was not true. Writing in the New York Times this week, the tech scholar Zeynep Tufekci called YouTube \u201cthe great radicalizer,\u201d detailing how its recommendation algorithm carries casual viewers down rabbit holes of extremism.\n\nAt South by Southwest on Tuesday, Wojcicki came prepared with a new plan to tackle conspiracy videos on YouTube. But the subsequent reaction suggested she hadn\u2019t come quite prepared enough.\n\nPointing to slides that displayed YouTube videos purveying conspiracies about the moon landing and chemtrails, Wojcicki said the company will begin displaying \u201cinformation cues\u201d drawn from Wikipedia alongside such clips. The cues come in the form of little blocks of text directly below the video. To determine which videos require such a counterweight, Wojcicki said, YouTube will draw on Wikipedia\u2019s own list of well-known conspiracy theories. She noted that YouTube could expand on that list over time.\n\nThis was all news to the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that administers the volunteer-edited Wikipedia. \u201cWe were not given advance notice of this announcement,\u201d the foundation said in a statement Wednesday, adding that there is no formal partnership between it and YouTube. While it did not explicitly object to YouTube using its content in this way, the nonprofit stressed that it relies on donors and unpaid editors, and that it \u201cdoes not control content or make editorial decisions about information that is included on Wikipedia.\u201d\n\nIn other words, an $800 billion company\u2014arguably the world\u2019s most important information source\u2014is outsourcing the job of combatting misinformation on its platform to a nonprofit built on free labor. And it didn\u2019t bother to tell them.\n\nEven if YouTube had handled this better, it\u2019s not clear that Wikipedia cards will do much to solve its problems. The approach is loosely analogous to one that Facebook began deploying in December 2016 to fight fake news. But Facebook later ditched its initial approach amid concerns that it might be backfiring (a finding that is itself disputed by some). After a year\u2019s worth of research, testing, and trial and error, there\u2019s been little evidence so far that the social network\u2019s efforts have made much difference in the spread of misinformation. That\u2019s one reason Facebook has simultaneously pursued several other avenues to improve the quality and credibility of news and information on its platform\u2014some more promising than others.\n\nOne rather glaring problem with YouTube\u2019s plan is that it seems ill-equipped to handle conspiracies that crop up rapidly in the wake of major news events such as the Parkland shooting. Those memes\u2014such as the one smearing Parkland survivor David Hogg as a \u201ccrisis actor\u201d\u2014are liable to make the rounds on YouTube well before they\u2019ve been authoritatively debunked on Wikipedia, let alone added to a master list of well-known conspiracies. Even with human moderators on hand, some of these conspiracy theories have scaled to the top of YouTube\u2019s prominent list of trending videos, and earned millions of views in the process, before being taken down.\n\nAnother issue: Wikipedia is vulnerable to trolls and propagandists, just as is any other platform that relies on the public to produce and curate content. It might become more so, now that people know Wikipedia holds the keys to YouTube\u2019s conspiracy-debunking apparatus, such as it is. One prominent Wikipedia editor was quick to warn that YouTube\u2019s misinformation problems run deeper than anything that could be solved by an \u201cirregularly updated *encyclopedia*.\u201d\n\n...huh.\n\n\n\n1) ok, seems fine. Hope they credit us appropriately\n\n2) I don't think YouTube can rely on our irregularly updated *encyclopedia* to solve its ranking algorithm/hate speech issue; ppl don't read refs.\n\n3) web 2.0 is wierd, man.\n\n\n\n/goes back to working on Wikipedia articles https://t.co/f9G1JZLTu2 \u2014 Phoebe Ayers (@phoebe_ayers) March 14, 2018\n\nOn the same day that Wojcicki was taking the stage in Austin on Tuesday to announce her big fix, a YouTube spokesperson was telling Vice News that the company had no idea why an InfoWars conspiracy video was topping its search results Monday for queries about the package explosions in Austin. The InfoWars video claimed, without evidence, that Antifa was a \u201cprime suspect\u201d in the bombings.\n\nIn the same speech, according to tweets by BuzzFeed News\u2019 Ryan Mac, Wired editor-in-chief Nick Thompson asked Wojcicki how YouTube decides which information sources are credible. Wojcicki declined to get specific, saying \u201cthere are usually complicated algorithms\u201d\u2014the sort of vague excuse that Facebook shopped for years before critics largely stopped buying it. She did suggest, however, that YouTube looks at the \u201cnumber of journalistic awards\u201d and \u201camount of traffic\u201d that various publishers have. If that\u2019s true, those are some awfully crude, extremely amateurish proxies\u2014more so even than Facebook\u2019s widely ridiculed publisher trust survey.\n\nIt appears, then, that YouTube is just beginning the journey of reckoning that Facebook was compelled by critics (and its own outraged employees) to undertake almost immediately after the 2016 election. Part of that journey will probably involve learning some humility: Just last month Wojcicki sniped at a media conference in California that Facebook \u201cshould get back to baby pictures,\u201d the implication being that it couldn\u2019t handle the grown-up responsibilities of a prominent news platform. One could imagine a similar dig at YouTube, perhaps swapping out baby pictures for cat videos.\n\nThe reality is that none of these platforms is going back to its comparatively innocent early days. Social media, for better or worse, has firmly established itself as a primary news source for huge swaths of the population, with younger generations leading that trend. That means YouTube, like Facebook and Twitter, is stuck with the responsibility of figuring out how to do a better job of informing its users. Excuses like the one Google\u2019s Richard Salgado offered to Congress in October\u2014that the company is a \u201ctechnology platform\u201d and therefore not in the news business\u2014no longer fly.\n\nIt\u2019s good to see YouTube finally beginning to acknowledge that it has a problem. The next step is for it to understand that solving that problem won\u2019t be easy, and quick fixes won\u2019t suffice. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg indicated in January that he understood fixing his platform will require a sustained, long-term effort. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said as much in a tweetstorm earlier this month.

She speaks Monday at the UW.\n\nFor three decades, seismologist Lucy Jones soothed the nerves of quake-rattled Californians with her calm explanations and common-sense preparedness tips. Her frequent media appearances, including some with her toddler cradled on her hip, earned her a level of celebrity unprecedented among earthquake scientists since Charles Richter lent his name to the first earthquake scale.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been called the Beyonc\u00e9 of earthquakes, the Meryl Streep of government service, a woman breaking barriers in a man\u2019s world,\u201d the Los Angeles Times wrote in 2016 when Jones retired from the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nNow director of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Society, the pioneering researcher and communicator\u2019s latest mission is helping cities boost their ability to bounce back from natural disasters by applying science in a way that makes a difference.\n\nLucy Jones: \u2018Life Safety in the City: When There is More to Life Than Not Being Crushed\u2019 4:30 p.m. Monday, Alder Hall Auditorium, 1315 N.E. Campus Parkway, University of Washington, Seattle. Sponsored by the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute Washington chapter and the UW Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. The event is free, but online registration is required at: http://bit.ly/2Gzvp7d\n\nJones got a taste of what it takes to spark political action during a temporary stint as Los Angeles\u2019 earthquake \u201cczar.\u201d She helped create a gripping earthquake scenario to spell out what\u2019s at stake and worked with politicians, building owners and affordable-housing advocates to push through the nation\u2019s most aggressive seismic regulations requiring upgrades to dangerous buildings and other infrastructure.\n\nOn Monday, Jones will make her pitch for better quake preparedness in the Pacific Northwest at a free, public lecture at the University of Washington. In a Q&A with The Seattle Times (edited for clarity and brevity), she discussed topics ranging from our dread of earthquakes to why modern building codes aren\u2019t as great as most people think, and how scientists have bungled explanations of earthquake risk.\n\nQuestion: California has the country\u2019s highest earthquake risk, but Washington is second. What\u2019s your message for us?\n\nAnswer: You in many ways have a more challenging problem because you have fewer everyday earthquakes to bring the issue to public attention.\n\nThe concept of normalization bias (which causes people to underestimate the likelihood of a disaster and its effects) is a very strong thing in the human psyche. We\u2019re clearly evolved to focus on more immediate threats and we need stories, we need emotional connections to understand why we need to take action.\n\nEarthquakes are very difficult to plan for because of those reasons, especially if you don\u2019t remember the last time you had one. In very quiet times, it\u2019s very hard to get people engaged.\n\nFor a policymaker to decide it\u2019s worthwhile spending money on this when you have competing claims of homelessness and other problems, you need an emotional reason to connect and relate to your constituents and scientists don\u2019t understand that.\n\nQ: What\u2019s wrong with the way scientists communicate earthquake risk?\n\nA: As scientists, we explicitly refuse to use stories. One of the favorite lines is: The plural of anecdote is not data.\n\nWhen we did the ShakeOut scenario in California, we worked to make it a story, we made a movie out of it, the public fact sheet was written as a narrative.\n\nWe did not focus on probability. Talking about the probability of an earthquake in some time frame focuses on the part of the problem we don\u2019t know the answer to. When you talk about the uncertainty, people can find a reason to think it won\u2019t happen.\n\nWhen I\u2019m asked about the probability of an earthquake, I say \u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent. Just give me enough time.\u201d\n\nQ: How can you overcome denial and fatalism? The prospect of a magnitude 9 Cascadia megaquake and tsunami seems so overwhelming many folks just shrug and say: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d\n\nA: I think that\u2019s one of the most dangerous things that happens.\n\nEarthquakes are random, you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s coming and that makes it much more frightening. When you have too much fear, you don\u2019t do anything. That\u2019s been a mistake in how we sometimes message. We think we\u2019ve got to scare people. But that doesn\u2019t get them to act. They just want to hide from it.\n\nThe Cascadia 9 sounds much worse than the 8 in California, but the reality is it doesn\u2019t mean the shaking is going to be stronger. Your fault is offshore, so nobody is sitting on top of the fault.\n\nIt\u2019s not going to be any worse than what happened in Japan in 2011, and 150 people died in that earthquake. You can build to withstand earthquakes, period.\n\nAbout 18,000 people died in the tsunami, but they have way more people living in the tsunami zone than Oregon and Washington. If the Japan tsunami had been anything like a normal tsunami \u2014 it was about three times bigger than anyone thought was possible \u2014 they really would have had very few deaths.\n\nBut you cannot get only 150 dead here and keep your unreinforced masonry buildings.\n\nQ: Seattle doesn\u2019t require seismic retrofits for old brick buildings, also called unreinforced masonry. Los Angeles did it 30 years ago, and now is requiring upgrades to old concrete and soft-story buildings with weak ground floors. What does it take to get political action on seismic safety?\n\nA: The tradition is that it takes killing a lot of people. Most California laws were created because an earthquake killed people and that created the impetus. What\u2019s been so impressive about what\u2019s happening in Southern California now is the willingness to pass legislation without killing people first.\n\nA very large part of that is political leadership from (Los Angeles) Mayor (Eric) Garcetti. He recognized that we have a huge problem of affordable housing, and when the earthquake happens we\u2019re going to lose a huge amount of those older apartment buildings. Unless we want to make the problem 10 times worse, we have to prevent those apartments from being destroyed.\n\nWe also held lots of meetings with lots of stakeholders and laid out the consequences if we do nothing.\n\nThe arguments that brought people along were mainly economic, not lifesaving.\n\nQ: A lot of earthquake planning focuses on emergency response and personal preparedness. Why isn\u2019t that enough?\n\nA: Because that accepts damage is inevitable. When people ask me about earthquake prediction, I say: Do you want two hours to get out of a building, or do you want a building that doesn\u2019t fall down in the first place?\n\nWhy figure out how to survive not having water instead of fixing your water pipes so they don\u2019t break?\n\nIn L.A., we came up with a high-priority list, and the process is continuing.\n\nWe mandated that building owners had to pay for retrofitting their buildings, but the city is going to take on fixing the water system.\n\nAt the time, the only company in the world making seismically resilient pipes was in Japan. The city of L.A. went to American manufacturers and said: \u201cWe are only buying resilient pipe,\u201d and now there are cost-effective options out there.\n\nQ: Seattle is in the midst of a building boom. Won\u2019t all those new high-rises be fine after an earthquake?\n\nA: No. The current building code is a life-safety code. The goal is to not kill people. If you chose to have a building that\u2019s a total financial loss after the earthquake, that\u2019s your choice to make.\n\nI have a problem with that. The reality of an earthquake is that the failure of a building impacts the whole community.\n\nLook at what happened in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2011. No new buildings collapsed, but they had to tear down 1,800 buildings and they lost their downtown.\n\nI\u2019ve been working with state assemblymen to move California\u2019s building code up to a function recovery standard, so buildings could be repaired in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nWho knows if it will happen?

As a result the market is embracing new ways of working.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s 330 natural disasters are estimated to have caused a global economic loss of $353bn (\u00a3251bn), with Harvey, Irma and Maria accounting for 60% of the insured losses.\n\nInga Beale, the Lloyd\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe market experienced an exceptionally difficult year in 2017, driven by challenging market conditions and a significant impact from natural catastrophes. These factors mean that for the first time in six years Lloyd\u2019s is reporting a loss.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe world\u2019s oldest insurance market made a pretax loss of \u00a32bn last year, compared with a \u00a32.1bn profit the previous year. The group\u2019s combined ratio \u2013 a measure of claims and costs as a proportion of premiums \u2013 worsened from 98% to 114%.

Along with other executives, she did not receive a bonus payout under the Lloyd\u2019s performance plan last year because the LPP only pays out if the company makes an annual profit of more than \u00a3100m.\n\nLloyd\u2019s was one of the first UK businesses to publish its gender pay gap, revealing that women earn 32.1% less than men (for bonuses the gap is even bigger at 40.7%).\n\nBeale said she was \u201cnot proud of that at all\u201d and that Lloyd\u2019s was taking action, having signed up to the government\u2019s women in finance charter and introduced a back to work programme for parents. Its goal is to have women in 40% of its top management jobs in the next five years, up from 33.8% today.\n\nWomen were not allowed into the Lloyd\u2019s underwriting room until 1973, when Liliana Archibald became the first female broker there.\n\nLloyd\u2019s reiterated that its new office in Brussels would be up and running by July, ready to start writing business in January.

In October 2016, we revisited our study area by conducting two flights with a Hercules C-130 aircraft that collected aerial imagery (n = 7,298 single-frame mosaics) to better quantify the larger and rarer >50 cm plastic objects (Fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1 Field monitoring effort. Vessel (grey and dark blue lines) and aircraft (light blue lines) tracks and locations where data on buoyant ocean plastic concentrations were collected (circles). Grey circles (n = 350) represent areas sampled with a single Manta net tow by 17 participating vessels, between July and September 2015. Dark blue circles (n = 76) represent areas sampled with paired Manta and paired Mega net tows by RV Ocean Starr, between July and August 2015. Light blue circles (n = 31) show locations of RGB geo-referenced mosaics collected from a C-130 Hercules aircraft, in October 2016. This map was created using QGIS version 2.18.1 (www.qgis.org). Full size image\n\nVessels carried out net tows of 0.35\u20134 hours duration, while navigating at 0.7\u20136.8 knots. All trawls were designed to move away from the vessel to avoid wake effects on the capture efficiency of the devices. All vessel crews were trained with online material and one-to-one workshops that had been conducted prior to departure. While towing the trawl, the most experienced sailor aboard the vessel estimated the sea state (Beaufort scale) by measuring wind speeds and observing wave heights. This data was recorded in the standard datasheets provided, alongside the date, duration, as well as initial and final coordinates of each tow. The location and length of all net tows were confirmed during the post-processing phase by inspecting the position data from GPS trackers installed on all participating vessels. Most sampling stations encompassed a single net tow (n = 350 sampling stations) using a Manta trawl (0.5 mm square mesh, 90 cm \u00d7 15 cm mouth), which is one of the standard devices for quantifying plastic pollution levels. With the largest participating vessel (RV Ocean Starr), we simultaneously towed two Manta trawls, alongside two large Neuston trawls (1.5 cm square mesh, 6 m \u00d7 1.5 m mouth, of which 0.5 m above the water line; thereafter called \u2018Mega trawls\u2019) at every sampling location (n = 76 stations). After each Manta net tow, the net was rinsed from the outside with seawater, and its single-use cod-end removed, closed with staples and placed in an individual zip-lock bag. After each Mega trawl tow, the net was also rinsed from the outside with seawater and its large cod-end opened in a box filled with seawater. All buoyant plastics were then removed, wrapped in aluminium and placed in labelled plastic bags. The whole content captured by the Manta trawls was stored, while the organisms captured by the Mega trawls (mostly alive) were released back into the ocean. All samples were stored in a fridge or freezer while at-sea, and in a FedEx cool box (2\u20138 \u00b0C) or reefer (\u22122 \u00b0C) while being shipped to the laboratory. Even though we were careful when handling samples, some debris items may have been broken during transportation, leading to some bias in our debris size distribution. Detailed information related to these net tows (i.e. coordinates, metocean conditions, sampling times and durations) is provided in Figshare33.\n\nThe aerial surveys sampled a far greater area (311.0 km2) than the trawl surveys described above (3.9 km2 and 13.6 km2, for Manta and Mega net tows, respectively), thus yielding a more reliable quantification of debris larger than 50 cm, which are relatively rare. Both flights started and ended at Moffett Airfield near Mountain View, California. The first aerial survey was conducted on October 2nd 2016 sampling from 18:56 to 21:14 UTC time, at a constant latitude of 33.5\u00b0N, and longitudes varying from 141.4\u00b0W to 134.9\u00b0W. The second survey started on October 6th 2016 sampling from 22:14 to 0:37 UTC, from 30.1\u00b0N, 143.7\u00b0W to 32.9\u00b0N, 138.1\u00b0W. While in survey mode, the aircraft flew at an altitude of approximately 400 m and at a ground speed of 140 knots. Sampling transects targeted areas where the sea state conditions were the lowest, based on the weather forecast, including sea surface atmospheric pressure, cloud cover, wind speed at 10 m above sea level and boundary surface layer height provided by NOAA\u2019s Global Forecasting System, as well as significant wave height and peak period data distributed by NOAA\u2019s WaveWatch3 model outputs. Even though we surveyed floating debris using trained observers and three types of sensor (Lidar, SWIR imager, and RGB camera), here we only analyse information coming from the geo-referenced mosaics produced by a RGB camera (CS-4800i) that generally took photographs every second during surveying time (frame size = ~360 m across track, ~240 m along track, ~0.1 m resolution).\n\nTrawl samples processing\n\nTrawl samples were separately washed into a sieve tower (five Glenammer Engineering Ltd sieves, with 0.05 cm, 0.15 cm, 0.5 cm, 1.5 cm, and 5 cm square apertures) that divided the material into the following size classes: 0.05\u20130.15 cm, 0.15\u20130.5 cm, 0.5\u20131.5 cm, 1.5\u20135 cm, and >5 cm. Debris items >5 cm were then manually sorted into 5\u201310 cm, 10\u201350 cm, and >50 cm classes by measuring the object lengths (widest dimension of the object) with a ruler. Buoyant debris was separated from biomass by placing the material within each sieve in filtered saltwater (salinity 3.5%, temperature 19\u201323 \u00b0C). Lab personnel stirred the material many times to insure floating particles were detached from the biomass material. Floating objects identified as buoyant debris were manually extracted from the water surface using forceps, separated into types, and counted. Buoyant debris was classified into material type (plastic, glass, paraffin, tar, rubber, wood, pumice, seed or unknown), with plastics being further divided into the following categories: (1) \u2018H\u2019 type \u2013 fragments and objects made of hard plastic, plastic sheet or film; (2) \u2018N\u2019 type \u2013 plastic lines, ropes, and fishing nets; (3) \u2018P\u2019 type \u2013 pre-production plastic pellets in the shape of a cylinder, disk or sphere; and (4) \u2018F\u2019 type \u2013 fragments or objects made of foamed material (e.g. expanded polystyrene). Once counted and categorized, the pieces were washed with distilled water, transferred to aluminium dishes, dried overnight at 60 \u00b0C, and weighed using an OHAUS Explorer EX324M (0.0001 g readability) for objects <5 cm, and a OHAUS Explorer EX12001M (0.1 g readability) for objects >5 cm.\n\nTo best characterize the ocean plastic accumulating within the GPGP, we performed additional analyses with the material collected. Firstly, 10 pieces within each plastic size/type category (n = 220 pieces) were selected for polymer composition analysis by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The readings were done using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR equipped with a universal ATR accessory (range = 600\u20134000 cm\u22121). The respective polymer type was determined by comparing sample FT-IR spectra against known spectra from a database (Perkin-Elmer ATR of Polymers Library). Secondly, we screened all plastic debris collected for production dates, as well as any writings statements giving information on its origin (i.e. language and \u2018made in\u2019 statements). Lastly, we classified plastic items from \u2018H\u2019 and \u2018L\u2019 types collected at 30 RV Ocean Starr stations into object types (e.g. bottle lids, bags, bottles, etc). As \u2018H\u2019 objects larger than 50 cm were relatively rare, we analysed 10 extra RV Ocean Starr stations for this type/size category. If the object type of a fragment could not be determined, we classified the piece as either hard plastic fragment or film fragment depending on its wall thickness and flexibility34. We used Manta trawl samples to characterise objects within size classes 0.15\u20130.5 cm, 0.5\u20131.5 cm, and 1.5\u20135 cm, and Mega trawl samples to characterise objects within size classes 5\u201310 cm, 10\u201350 cm, and >50 cm. Plastics within our smallest size class (0.05\u20130.15 cm) were not considered in this \u2018Object Type\u2019 analysis due to the difficulty of handling and identifying small fragments.\n\nThe numerical/mass concentrations of buoyant plastic items (count/kg of plastic per km2 of sea surface) measured by each net tow were calculated for all plastic size/type categories separately. To do so, we divided the count and weight of plastic objects within each category by the towed area of the sample. We calculated the towed area by multiplying net mouth width (90 cm for Manta trawl, 6 m for Mega trawl) by tow length (determined from GPS position data). The average area covered by Manta net tows was 0.008 km2 (SD = 0.004, min\u2013max: 0.001\u20130.018 km2), while the average area covered by Mega net tows was 0.090 km2, (SD = 0.013, min\u2013max: 0.046\u20130.125 km2). As buoyant plastics can be missed by surface trawls due to wind-driven mixing, we then estimated the \u2018depth-integrated\u2019 mass and numerical plastic concentrations (Ci) for all type/size categories at each of the trawl sampling locations using the equations described in ref.35. Supplementary Methods 1 provides details on how Ci was calculated as a function of ocean plastic terminal rising velocity (Wb), depth sampled by the trawl, and sea state. It also describes how we measured Wb for each of the type/size categories of this study. After comparing plastic concentration results obtained by paired Manta and Mega net tows (n = 76 locations), we decided to use Manta and Mega trawl samples to quantify debris 0.05\u20135 cm and 5\u201350 cm in size, respectively. The comparison results and reasoning behind such decision in provided in Supplementary Methods 2.\n\nAerial imagery processing\n\nAll RGB images taken during our survey flights (n = 7,298) were georeferenced using accurate aircraft position and altitude data collected during the surveys. They were then inspected by two trained observers and a detection algorithm. Observers inspected all images at full-screen on a Samsung HD monitor (LU28E590DS/XY) and those single-frame mosaics containing debris were uploaded into QGIS software (Version 2.18.3\u2013Las Palmas) to record their position and characteristics. We trust we had a very small number of false positives and a high number of false negatives. This is because the observers took a conservative approach: they only logged features as debris when they were very confident with its identification. As such, many features that could be debris, but resembled other natural features, such as sun glint and breaking wave, were not logged into our ocean plastic dataset. Once this work was finalised, we ran an experimental algorithm capable of detecting potential debris in all our RGB mosaics as a quality control step. To avoid any false positives, all features detected by the algorithm were also visually inspected by an observer and only those visually identified as debris were logged in our QGIS database. For every sighting, we recorded position (latitude, longitude), length (widest dimension of the object), width, and object type: (1) \u2018bundled net\u2019 \u2013 a group of fishing nets bundled tightly together; they are commonly colourful and of a rounded shape; (2) \u2018loose net\u2019 \u2013 a single fishing net; they were generally quite translucent and rectangular in shape; (3) \u2018container\u2019 \u2013 rectangular and bright objects, such as fishing crates and drums; (4) \u2018rope\u2019 \u2013 long cylindrical objects around 15 cm thick; (5) \u2018buoy/lid\u2019, rounded bright objects that could be either a large lid or a buoy; (6) \u2018unknown\u2019 \u2013 objects that are clearly debris but whose object type was not identified, they were mostly irregular-shaped items resembling plastic fragments; and (7) Other \u2013 only one object was successfully identified but did not belong to any category above: a life ring. We recorded 1,595 debris items (403 and 1,192 in flights 1 and 2 respectively); 626 were 10\u201350 cm and 969 were >50 cm in length. Most of them were classified as \u2018unknown\u2019 (78% for 10\u201350 cm, 32% for >50 cm), followed by \u2018buoy or lid\u2019 (20%) and \u2018bundled net\u2019 (1%) for 10\u201350 cm debris, and by \u2018bundled net\u2019 (29%), \u2018container\u2019 (18%), \u2018buoy or lid\u2019 (9%), \u2018rope\u2019 (6%), and \u2018lose net\u2019 (4%) for >50 cm debris. To calculate ocean plastic concentrations, we grouped the geo-referenced images into 31 ~10 km2 mosaics. For numerical concentrations, we simply divided the number of debris pieces 10\u201350 cm and >50 cm within each mosaic by the area covered. To estimate mass concentrations, we had to first estimate the mass of each object spotted, then we separately summed the mass of 10\u201350 cm and >50 cm debris within each mosaic by the area covered. More information on how we estimated the mass of each spotted objects is provided in Supplementary Methods 3.\n\nNumerical model formulation\n\nOcean plastic pathways can be represented by Lagrangian particle trajectories31. In our framework, particles were advected by the following environmental drivers: sea surface currents, wave induced Stokes drift and winds. Starting from identical particle releases, we produced a series of forcing scenarios to represent the diversity in shape and composition of ocean plastics. Starting from using sea surface current only, we gradually added forcing terms representing the actions of atmospheric drag and wind waves on buoyant debris. The action of wind was simulated by considering the displacement of particles as a fraction of wind speed at 10 m above sea level. This is referred as the \u2018windage coefficient\u2019. We assessed different windage coefficient scenarios including 0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 2% and 3%. We sourced global sea surface currents (1993 to 2012) from the HYCOM + NCODA global 1/12\u00b0 reanalysis (experiment 19.0 and 19.136,37,38), and wind (10 m above sea level) speed and direction data (1993 to 2012) from NCEP/NCAR global reanalysis39. Wave induced Stokes drift amplitude was calculated using wave spectrum bulk coefficients (significant wave height, peak wave period and direction) from Wavewatch3 model outputs40.\n\nFor every forcing scenario, particles were identically and continuously released in time from 1993 to 2012 following spatial distributions and amplitudes of significant ocean plastic sources on land (coastal population hotspots23 and major rivers24) as well as at sea (fishing26,41, aquaculture42 and shipping industries43). Source scenarios were combined using relative source contribution as well as geographical distribution presented in Supplementary Methods 4. We advected global particles in time using the forcing scenarios described above and successfully reproduced the formation of oceanic garbage patches, with the shape and gradient of particle concentrations in these areas differing amongst forcing scenarios. We computed daily particle visits over 0.2\u00b0 resolution grids corresponding to our observation domain and extending from 160\u00b0W to 120\u00b0W in longitude and 20\u00b0N to 45\u00b0N in latitude. The number of daily particle visits was uniformized over the total number of particles present in the global model at a given time. The model-predicted non-dimensional concentration \u03b4 i of cell i, was calculated as follows:\n\n\u03b4 i = \u2211 s \u03b1 s \u03b4 i , s (1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 s is the non-dimensional weight relative to the contribution of source s and \u03b4 i,s is the percentage of global particles from source s in cell i. \u03b4 i,s is calculated with the number of particles n i,s from source s in cell i over the total number of global particles \u03a3 i n s from source s:\n\n\u03b4 i , s = n i , s \u2211 i n s (2)\n\nNumerical model calibration\n\nWe collected measurements at sea in 2015 and 2016, but our numerical model uses ocean circulation reanalysis covering the period from 1993 to 2012. Modelled ocean circulation data post-2012 is available from HYCOM however not as a reanalysis product. As such, we decided not to use it in this study. As initial model particles released in 1993 significantly start to accumulate in the area after about 7 years, we averaged uniformized daily particle visits over 12 years, from 2000 to 2012. We grouped observed debris size classes in four categories: microplastics (0.05\u20130.5 cm), mesoplastics (0.5\u20135 cm), macroplastics (5\u201350 cm) and megaplastics (>50 cm). We compared model predictions against depth-integrated microplastic concentrations as this dataset collected by Manta trawls had the largest spatial coverage. Mass concentrations derived from trawl measurements were grouped in 0.2-degree resolution cells and compared against model-predicted non-dimensional concentration \u03b4 for the five different forcing scenarios. The best model fit was found for the forcing scenario with sea-surface current only (R2 = 0.52, n = 277 cells). The regression coefficient declined as we increased the atmospheric drag term (R2 = 0.39 to 0.21 depending on windage coefficient).\n\nAs we analysed the accumulation of model particles in the GPGP region, we noticed significant seasonal and inter-annual variations of the GPGP position. The modelled GPGP dimensions was relatively consistent throughout our 12 years of analysis, but the relative position of this accumulation zone varied with years and seasons. We first decided to test our model for seasonal variation by comparing our microplastic concentrations (measured in July \u2013 September 2015) against modelled concentrations averages for the July\u2013September periods of 2000 to 2012. This comparison yielded poorer results (R2 = 0.46 to 0.21, depending on forcing scenario) than with the 12 years average solution (R2 = 0.52) as the July\u2013September GPGP position varied substantially among years.\n\nThe relation between the accumulation of marine debris in the North Pacific and climate events such as El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has previously been discussed18. As such, to account for inter-annual variation, we compared latitudinal and longitudinal position of the GPGP against these two climate indexes: ENSO and PDO. We found that 2002 and 2004 were similar to the conditions experienced during our multi-vessel expedition. Thus, we compared our measurements against particle visit averages for July\u2013September of 2002 and 2004 combined. This second attempt exhibited better results (R2 = 0.58 to 0.41, depending on forcing scenario), suggesting that climatic events such as ENSO or PDO influence the average position of the GPGP. Therefore, we decided to use the July\u2013September average for 2002 and 2004, which better accounts for inter-annual variations in the GPGP position. More information on the selection of years for calibrating the model against trawl and aerial surveys data is provided in Supplementary Methods 5. The best fit between model predictions and microplastic observations was found once again for the forcing scenario with sea surface current only (R2 = 0.58, n = 277). The best regression fit between measured and modelled microplastic concentrations had a = \u22128.3068 and b = 0.6770 in the parametric formulation:\n\nc m o d = 10 log 10 \u03b4 \u2212 a b (3)\n\nFrom this formulation, we computed the modelled microplastics mass concentration in our domain area and extracted contour levels by order of magnitude, from 0.01 g km\u22122 to 10 kg km\u22122. The GPGP as defined in this study corresponds to the 1 kg km\u22122 microplastic mass concentration level covering an area of 1.6 million km2 and depicted as a bold line in Fig. 2a. As a validation, we categorized microplastics measurements inside and outside the 1 kg km\u22122 contour line (Fig. 2b). For stations inside the model-predicted GPGP, the median measured microplastic concentration was 1.8 kg km\u22122 (25th\u201375th percentiles = 3.5\u20130.9 kg km\u22122) while for stations outside, the median was 0.3 kg km\u22122 (25th\u201375th percentiles = 0.2\u20130.7 kg km\u22122). Using our calibrated microplastics distribution, we computed the mass and numerical concentration for individual size classes from scaling modelled concentrations by the ratio between average modelled microplastics distribution inside the GPGP and averaged measured concentrations per size class of stations inside the patch. A comparison between measured and modelled mass/numerical concentrations for all ocean plastic size classes is given in Fig. 2c and d.\n\nFigure 2 Numerical model calibration. (a) The GPGP boundary (blue line) is estimated by comparing microplastic concentration measurements (circles) to model particle visit averages that accounted for seasonal and inter-annual variations. This map was created using QGIS version 2.18.1 (www.qgis.org). (b) Model validation showing median measured mass concentration for microplastics of stations outside and inside our predicted 1 kg km\u22122 GPGP boundary. Bars extend from 25th to 75th percentile while whiskers extend to minimum and maximum non-outlier. Outliers are represented as crosses. (c) Measured mass concentrations versus modelled mass concentrations for microplastics, mesoplastics, macroplastics and megaplastics. (d) Same as (c) but with numerical concentrations. Full size image\n\nOur confidence intervals were formulated to account for uncertainties in both sampling and modelling. For the trawl collection (i.e. micro-, meso- and macroplastics), we considered uncertainties related to the vertical-mixing corrections applied to surface concentrations using reported sea state and plastic\u2019s rising velocities (see Supplementary Methods 1). For the aerial mosaics, we accounted for uncertainties related to estimating the mass of sighted objects based on correlations between top-view area and dry weight of objects collected in the trawls (see Supplementary Methods 3). Finally, to account for modelling uncertainties, we added (respectively subtracted) the standard error of measured concentration to (resp. from) the mean upper (resp. lower) mass concentration when scaling the microplastics distribution to individual size classes.\n\nCharacterisation by types, sources and forcing scenarios\n\nThe total estimated mass load of ocean plastic in the GPGP by size classes were further divided by types. We calculated the average fraction in mass of individual ocean plastic types per sampling event for stations inside the patch (Supplementary Table 1) and derived the contribution of types \u2018H\u2019, \u2018N\u2019, \u2018F\u2019 and \u2018P\u2019. Further, as we predominantly observed debris originated from marine sources, we investigated the source contribution predicted by our calibrated modelled distribution. For individual model cells, we calculated the percentage of Lagrangian particle visits from individual sources. As initial particles were weighted in accordance to estimated global inputs, model particles from marine sources originally represented 28.1% of the total amount of material with fishing (17.9%), aquaculture (1.3%) and shipping (8.9%). We calculated the difference from this initial percentage value for each model cell and reported it to the predicted total mass concentration. In doing so, we defined \u2018anomalies\u2019 in marine source contribution in the North Pacific and expressed these in unit of mass per surface area. Finally, even though our calibrated model considered sea surface current only, we compared the predominance of forcing scenarios by evaluating the respective number of particle visits for each model cells. We computed contours around the GPGP for individual forcing scenarios in a way that the material contained inside each contour is equal to our initial forcing scenario (i.e. sea surface current only).\n\nThe dependence of the particle trajectory on the windage coefficient predicted by our model is in good agreement with sightings and modelling of debris originated from the 2011 Tohoku tsunami in Japan44,45. The first identified Japanese debris items that arrived after 10 to 12 months on the North American shores were objects with high windage such as buoys, boats and floating docks. Debris also arrived on Hawaiian Islands 18 months after the incident. The time of arrival was closely related to object types, starting in the first year with large oyster farm buoys and other floats, containers, and canisters. In the second year more buoys, tipped boats, fridges, and pallets arrived, followed later by timber beams and wooden debris. Our model predicted that only objects with a windage coefficient above 3% could arrive on Hawaii in the second year after the 2011 tsunami. Objects with windage coefficient ranging from 1 to 2% would reach Hawaii during the third year, while objects with no windage would mostly accumulate in the GPGP, north east of the archipelago.\n\nLong term analysis\n\nThe definition of a dynamic GPGP boundary that accounts for seasonal and inter-annual variabilities allowed us to estimate which sea surface trawl data points from the literature are inside or outside the GPGP region. Therefore, we used our calibrated model to assess the decadal evolution of microplastic mass concentrations (kg km\u22122) within and around the GPGP. Concentration data from the literature (Supplementary Table 2) was obtained from published datasets or digitized from figures when not available digitally17,46,47. When data was reported in unit of mass per volume of water48, we used the net tow depth to calculate the concentration per surface area unit. When only numerical concentration was reported22,48, we estimated mass concentration by using the average ocean plastic mass from net tows where both mass and numerical concentrations were reported (m = 3.53 mg, SE: 0.10 mg, n = 872).\n\nWe compared the model-predicted GPGP boundary with the locations of samples collected between 1999 and 201221,22,48,49. Samples collected before 199917,46,47,48 were compared against the GPGP position estimated for the sampled months and years in the 1999\u20132012 period that had similar ENSO and PDO values (See Supplementary Methods 6). Using our dynamic GPGP model boundary as reference, we classified each net tow into 3 categories: (1) sampled within the GPGP boundary, (2) sampled outside the GPGP boundary, but above 20\u00b0N and below 45\u00b0N and (3) sampled in the rest of the North Pacific. We only used net tows from the first two categories above so that concentration statistics for outside the patch were not biased by measurements taken in equatorial and polar waters, where concentrations were very low. We then grouped these microplastic concentration observations from plankton net trawls by decades, taking data recorded between 1965\u20131974 (n = 20 inside and n = 58 outside17,48), 1975\u20131984 (n = 0 inside and n = 19 outside46), 1985\u20131994 (n = 4 inside and n = 2 outside47), 1995\u20132004 (n = 2 inside and n = 252 outside22,49), 2005\u20132014 (n = 195 inside and n = 861 outside21,22,48) and finally 2015 (n = 288 inside and n = 213 outside; this study). We calculated the mean (\u00b1 standard error) of measured microplastic mass concentration per decades for within and around the GPGP boundary. Finally, we extracted decadal trends by fitting an exponential function (R2 = 0.94) assuming null concentrations at the beginning of the 20th century. The exponential fit exhibited better results than linear, quadratic or cubic functions (R2 = 0.71, R2 = 0.86 and R2 = 0.91, respectively).", "title": "Evidence that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is rapidly accumulating plastic"}, {"url": "https://www.theoceancleanup.com/press/great-pacific-garbage-patch-growing-rapidly-study-shows/", "content": "This site makes use of third-party cookies for analytics.

(Photo: The Ocean Cleanup)\n\nThe world's largest collection of ocean garbage is growing.\n\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a collection of plastic, floating trash halfway between Hawaii and California, has grown to more than 600,000 square miles, a study published Thursday found. That's twice the size of Texas.\n\nWinds and converging ocean currents funnel the garbage into a central location, said study lead author Laurent Lebreton of the Ocean Cleanup Foundation, a non-profit organization that spearheaded the research.\n\nFirst discovered in the early 1990s, the trash in the patch comes from around the Pacific Rim, including nations in Asia and North and South America, Lebreton said.\n\nThe patch is not a solid mass of plastic. It includes about 1.8 trillion pieces and weighs 88,000 tons \u2014 the equivalent of 500 jumbo jets. The new figures are as much as 16 times higher than previous estimates.\n\nThe research \u2014 the most complete study undertaken of the garbage patch \u2014 was published Thursday in the peer-reviewed journal Scientific Reports.\n\n\"We were surprised by the amount of large plastic objects we encountered,\u201d said Julia Reisser of the foundation. \u201cWe used to think most of the debris consists of small fragments, but this new analysis shines a new light on the scope of the debris.\"\n\nThe study was based on a three-year mapping effort by an international team of scientists affiliated with the Ocean Cleanup Foundation, six universities and an aerial sensor company.\n\nMore: Our trash harms the deepest fish in the ocean\n\nMore: Humans have produced 18.2 trillion pounds of plastic since the '50s. That's equal in size to 1 billion elephants.\n\nSadly, the Pacific patch isn't alone. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is the largest of five such trash collections in the ocean, Lebreton said.\n\nCLOSE This video shows the devastating plastic waste that is overtaking the waters near Bali. Buzz60\n\nScientists work with the European Space Agency to take photos of the garbage patches from space.\n\nNo governments have stepped up to clean the trash, which is in international waters, so it's up to privately funded groups such as the Ocean Cleanup Foundation to take the lead in getting rid of the garbage.\n\nThere's a sense of urgency, said Joost Dubois, a spokesman with the foundation.\n\n\"It's a ticking time bomb of larger material,\" Dubois said. \"We've got to get it before it breaks down into a size that's too small to collect and also dangerous for marine life.\"\n\nSince plastic has been around only since the 1950s, there's no way of knowing exactly how long it will last in the ocean. If left alone, the plastic could remain there for decades, centuries or even longer.\n\n\"Unless we begin to remove it, some would say it may remain there forever,\" Lebreton said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2GeRHO8", "title": "Pacific garbage patch, largest collection of ocean trash, grows"}, {"url": "://story/dgoxP3Ls0mOzuiM?ned=us", "content": "", "title": ""}, {"url": "http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/mar/08/after-a-self-imposed-hiatus-seattles-bryan-john-ap/", "content": "Seattle singer/songwriter Bryan John Appleby\u2019s most recent tweet was posted Feb. 21, 2017.\n\nIn it, he praises an essay by writer Ijeoma Oluo called \u201cWhite People: I Don\u2019t Want You to Understand Me Better, I Want You to Understand Yourselves.\u201d\n\nHe was a little more active on Facebook last year, posting sporadically about small tours and one-off shows.\n\nAfter taking a bit of a self-imposed hiatus from his own music in 2017, Appleby is getting back into the swing of things with a handful of headlining gigs, including a stop at the Bartlett on Friday.\n\nAppleby\u2019s hiatus came a year after the release of his sophomore album \u201cThe Narrow Valley,\u201d a concept album that begins with an earthquake hitting a small California town and goes onto explore moments in the lives of the townspeople before the earthquake hit.\n\nIt\u2019s a sweeping orchestral pop record with a story brought to life through Appleby\u2019s cinematic lyrics.\n\n\u201cThe Fault Line cracked a long smile/A hideous rock-tooth grin open wide/\u2026A broken bedside vase, then our books flew from their case/And the walls began to shed their plaster hides,\u201d Appleby sings on the opening track \u201cThe Fault Line.\u201d\n\nAs a songwriter, Appleby has always looked to visual arts for inspiration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m finding just as much to get excited about in watching movies or reading really descriptive literature as I am in finding ideas in other people\u2019s music,\u201d he said. \u201cMusical inspiration is definitely just one brick in the wall of inspiration. It\u2019s not necessarily even the cornerstone.\u201d\n\nThe first half of 2016 found Appleby and his band touring in support of the album. But after the initial bout of promotion passed and funds began to dwindle, Appleby made the decision to begin touring solo.\n\nAppleby can see himself putting together a band for a show or two here and there, but for the time being, he\u2019s enjoying the freedom performing solo has afforded him.\n\n\u201cThat shift in emphasis definitely gave me moments of freedom and a little bit more air as far as not having restraints or needing to make things work on a large scale for a whole team of folks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m no longer carrying all of that weight and therefore can re-examine my relationship to all sorts of things but specifically reexamine my relationship to the industry and the album cycle and all the built in, baked in expectations of turnaround time.\u201d\n\nWith a new leisurely approach to performing and the music industry, Appleby decided to switch gears from the guitar to the drums, the first instrument he learned to play.\n\nHe backed friend Garett van der Spek, who performs as Prism Tats, for what was supposed to be one show but ended up performing nearly two dozen shows with him last year.\n\nHe also played guitar with Seattle\u2019s Tomten.\n\nAppleby saw his time out of the spotlight as a chance for his well of inspiration to fill up again, though he also used it as a chance to step back at a time when another man was doing plenty of talking.\n\n\u201cMy narrative and my experience, I didn\u2019t feel like exploring that publicly in a moment when all of a sudden there\u2019s a really loud white guy in charge of everything in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just felt like a better year to be listening than it did to be declaring things.\u201d\n\nAfter a year of listening and with a well of inspiration filled with \u201chundreds of 42-second voice memos from the last two years,\u201d Appleby has once again picked up the guitar and is in the process of writing new music.\n\nWhile he\u2019s grateful for the work of producers Sam Anderson, on \u201cThe Narrow Valley,\u201d and Kevin Watley, on 2011\u2019s \u201cFire on the Vine,\u201d and he\u2019s proud of the \u201ccinematic, layered, lush\u201d feel of \u201cThe Narrow Valley,\u201d Appleby doesn\u2019t think his next two or three records will be as expansive.\n\nFor one thing, he doesn\u2019t want to go into debt to release an album, as he\u2019s still paying off the debt from \u201cThe Narrow Valley.\u201d\n\nBut he\u2019s also curious to see the kind of music he can make when, as he put it, he doesn\u2019t have bells and whistles to rely on.\n\n\u201cWhat is the kernel of an idea? What\u2019s the thing that really is good here?\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on polishing that rather than paying a bunch of people to make it sound really, really cool.\u201d\n\nAnd, as silly as it sounds, Appleby is looking forward to finding out, more than 10 years into his career, what he sounds like.\n\nHe said though \u201cThe Narrow Valley\u201d and \u201cFire on the Vine\u201d were released under his name, the albums were fairly collaborative efforts with Anderson and Watley, with 50 percent, the lyrics, chords and melodies, coming from Appleby and the other 50 percent, the character of the sound and how the albums were voiced, coming from the producers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing I\u2019m excited to explore,\u201d he said. \u201cFor better or for worse, what does it sound like when it\u2019s 90 percent me with a few friends here and there rather than these grand gestures with a producer?\u201d", "title": "After a self-imposed hiatus, Seattle\u2019s Bryan John Appleby returns to center stage"}, {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02784-7", "content": "The eruption of Mount St Helens in 1980 caused the deaths of 57 people.Credit: KPA/Zuma/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe world needs to do more to prepare for the next huge volcanic eruption, a team of leading scientists says.\n\nThe devastating Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 and the T\u014dhoku earthquake in Japan in 2011 highlighted some of the worst-case scenarios for natural disasters. But humanity has not had to deal with a cataclysmic volcanic disaster since at least 1815, when the eruption of Tambora in Indonesia killed tens of thousands of people and led to a \u2018year without a summer\u2019 in Europe and North America. Such world-altering blasts rank at 7 or more on the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) scale of eruptions, which goes to 8.\n\n\u201cThe next VEI-7 eruption could occur within our lifetimes, or it could be hundreds of years down the road,\u201d says Chris Newhall, a volcanologist with the Mirisbiris Garden and Nature Center in Santo Domingo, Philippines. But the time to have this discussion is now, he says, so that researchers and government officials can plan and prepare before an emergency strikes.\n\nNewhall is the lead author of a paper published last week in Geosphere1 that explores the potential consequences of the next VEI-7 eruption. His co-authors are volcanologist Stephen Self of the University of California, Berkeley \u2014 with whom Newhall devised the VEI scale2 in 1982 \u2014 and Alan Robock, a climate scientist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. All three have researched the VEI-5 eruption of Mount St Helens in Washington state in 1980, and the VEI-6 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991.\n\nThose events killed dozens to hundreds of people and disrupted entire regions. Pinatubo even spewed enough sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to cause global cooling. But a VEI-7 eruption would be of an entirely different scale. In 1257, a VEI-7 eruption in what is now Indonesia probably cooled the planet down enough to kick off a centuries-long cold snap called the Little Ice Age, Robock says. \u201cThese things are hugely important for the planet, but the next one will take place in quite a different environment,\u201d he adds.\n\nA globalized world\n\nAgriculture, health care, financial systems and other aspects of modern life are much more globally interconnected than they were just a few decades ago, the scientists say. Eight years ago, an eruption that ranked at just VEI 3 \u2014 Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull, in Iceland \u2014 grounded European air traffic for days because of the danger of flying through volcanic ash. The event caused an estimated US$5 billion in economic losses.\n\nNewhall\u2019s team says that researchers should start to prepare for a VEI-7 eruption by studying potential effects on crucial communications links \u2014 such as how atmospheric moisture and volcanic ash can interfere with global positioning system signals. Others could work to improve their understanding of how large amounts of magma accumulate and erupt, helping scientists to forecast where the next VEI-7 event might occur.\n\nThe researchers already have a long list of candidate volcanoes that might be capable of a VEI-7 blast. They include Taupo in New Zealand, site of the world\u2019s last VEI-8 eruption \u2014 26,500 years ago \u2014 and Iran\u2019s Mount Damavand, which lies just 50 kilometres from Tehran.\n\nPreparing for rare but deadly eruptions is as important as dealing with smaller, more-frequent ones, says Janine Krippner, a volcanologist at Concord University in Athens, West Virginia. \u201cEven with the lower probability of these larger events, when they do occur people will look to scientists, emergency managers, governments and other entities and expect them to be prepared,\u201d she says. \u201cWe owe it to our communities to be researching potentially devastating eruptions, so we can guide people on what to do.\u201d", "title": "Volcanologists warn world is unprepared for next major eruption"}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2018/03/photos-of-the-week-the-sydney-skinny-a-glacial-arch-pelicans-at-play/555797/", "content": "Skijoring in Montana, a Russian presidential candidate in Moscow, economic disparity in Manila, a walkout against gun violence across the United States, civilians fleeing the battlefields of Syria, ski mountaineering in France, a balloon designer in Australia, the stark and lonely route of a German volunteer mailman in Schleswig-Holstein, and much more.", "title": "Photos of the Week: the Sydney Skinny, a Glacial Arch, Pelicans at Play"}, {"url": "http://wamc.org/post/blair-horner-fukushima-anniversary-and-ny-s-subsidies-nuclear-power", "content": "Last weekend was the seventh anniversary of the disaster at the Japanese nuclear power plant located in Fukushima. On March 11, 2011, an earthquake occurred in the Pacific Ocean that spawned a huge tsunami. The quake itself caused considerable damage to the Japanese islands near the center of the quake, but the tsunami\u2019s impact was catastrophic.\n\nThe waves caused by the earthquake hit the Fukushima area with such force that over one million buildings were partially or completely destroyed and about 19,000 residents were killed.\n\nAt the same time, eleven reactors at four nuclear power plants in the region were forced to shut down. However, the tsunami disabled the emergency generators that would have provided power to control and operate the pumps necessary to cool the superheated reactors. The insufficient cooling led to three nuclear meltdowns, hydrogen-air explosions, and the release of radioactive material during the next few days after the tsunami hit.\n\nThe result of this disaster forced tens of thousands of Japanese to relocate from the area and the uncontrolled release of radioactive materials into the area and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe power plants in Fukushima are of the same design as some in New York State, which are located on Lake Ontario. While no one would expect the same scenario to occur, those plants have been the focus of state policies in recent years.\n\nThe plants, built in the 1960s, have exceeded their expected useful lifetimes. Generally, plants of that design and era are expected to be used for roughly 40 or so years. Yet those plants continue to operate under a deal negotiated largely outside of public view.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, negotiators from the Cuomo Administration and the plant owners agreed to a multi-billion dollar bailout of the plants \u2013 which were slated for closure. At that time, the state did not reveal the estimated costs, but subsequent analyses estimated that the costs could run anywhere from $2.9 billion to $7.6 billion over a 12-year period. The negotiation contained no new safety requirements for the plants, just a guarantee that virtually all New Yorkers would be required to pay to make the nuke plants profitable \u2013 whether they received power from the plants or not \u2013 to keep them open.\n\nThe safety records of the plants came under new scrutiny in a report issued last week by the Alliance for a Green Economy, an upstate New York nuclear watchdog organization. The report analyzed recent inspection reports and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) documents and identified three issues of concern:\n\nThe group identified regulatory violations without penalties: 18 violations of Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were reported between March 2017 and February 2018 for the four Upstate reactors, but no penalties or fines were assessed.\n\nThe group identified examples of weakened regulations at the request of nuclear operators. For example, at the request of one of the plant\u2019s owners, the National Regulatory Commission changed the requirement for what constitutes an \u201cunusual event\u201d regarding Lake Ontario flooding. As we all know, there had been extensive flooding last year in the Lake Ontario area.\n\nLastly, the group identified missed deadlines for fixing known safety and maintenance issues: one plant near Oswego does not have a containment vessel likely to be able to contain the pressure and radiation released by a meltdown and installation of a required vent has been delayed; the plant\u2019s owner is behind schedule for fixing numerous maintenance issues.\n\nNew York State should learn the lessons of the dangers of relying on nuclear power and follow the path set by California: move to shut down these aging facilities, and instead move toward greater reliance on solar, wind and geothermal power. Those power generators have been starved of adequate support since so much of the state\u2019s wealth is tied up in propping up the Lake Ontario plants. New York energy efficiency programs are anemic and lag far behind neighboring states and currently solar only generates about 1 percent of the power for the state. Instead of mandating that New Yorkers subsidize aging, inefficient, 20th century nuclear plants, that money should be redirected to 21st century conservation and renewable energy programs.\n\nBlair Horner is executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group.\n\nThe views expressed by commentators are solely those of the authors.

Photos by Thinkstock and YouTube.\n\nAlmost since its founding, Twitter has regarded itself as a platform for news; watershed moments in the company\u2019s history included the Arab Spring and a 2011 East Coast earthquake. Facebook began talking as early as 2013 about wanting to be a sort of \u201cpersonalized newspaper,\u201d only to realize more recently that separating real news from propaganda was harder than it had anticipated. Both companies have spent much of the past year reckoning with their roles in spreading hoaxes, facilitating election interference, and fueling societal division and extremism.\n\nGoogle\u2019s YouTube, in contrast, has until recently managed to skirt the brunt of the criticism that rival social media platforms have faced. As a result, it has been relatively slow to grapple with the implications of its role as a source of news\u2014and, inevitably, of misinformation. As recently as October, in a series of congressional hearings, Google downplayed the significance of its video platform in Russian election interference, while Facebook and Twitter fielded the toughest questions.\n\nNow a series of controversies is forcing YouTube to address its responsibilities more directly and candidly than it has in the past. At the South by Southwest Interactive conference this week in Austin, Texas, an appearance by YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki made it clear that the platform is finally giving serious thought to the quality and veracity of information its users are getting. It also made clear that the company has a lot of catching up to do.\n\nIn January, star YouTube vlogger Logan Paul sparked a backlash when he published a video showing the dead body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan. Google responded by canceling Paul\u2019s \u201cpreferred\u201d ad deal and suspending his projects for its premium video service, YouTube Red. That came as the company was already dealing with a series of reports revealing disturbing cartoons apparently aimed at kids (it subsequently deleted 150,000 of them) and another genre of videos depicting children in abusive situations. The latter prompted the company to hire thousands more human moderators to review content for potential policy violations.\n\nBut it has since become obvious that YouTube\u2019s problems aren\u2019t simply a matter of manpower. They flow from the company\u2019s confusion about the nature of its business and the extent of its responsibilities.\n\n.@SusanWojcicki \"If there is an important news event we want to be delivering the right information.\"\n\n\n\nMinutes later she says, \"We are not a news organization.\" \u2014 Ryan Mac (@RMac18) March 13, 2018\n\nIn February, YouTube\u2019s algorithms boosted conspiracy videos attacking the children who survived the Parkland, Florida, school massacre. This month, influential YouTube conspiracy theorist Alex Jones claimed the company was about to delete his channel, a claim YouTube said was not true. Writing in the New York Times this week, the tech scholar Zeynep Tufekci called YouTube \u201cthe great radicalizer,\u201d detailing how its recommendation algorithm carries casual viewers down rabbit holes of extremism.\n\nAt South by Southwest on Tuesday, Wojcicki came prepared with a new plan to tackle conspiracy videos on YouTube. But the subsequent reaction suggested she hadn\u2019t come quite prepared enough.\n\nPointing to slides that displayed YouTube videos purveying conspiracies about the moon landing and chemtrails, Wojcicki said the company will begin displaying \u201cinformation cues\u201d drawn from Wikipedia alongside such clips. The cues come in the form of little blocks of text directly below the video. To determine which videos require such a counterweight, Wojcicki said, YouTube will draw on Wikipedia\u2019s own list of well-known conspiracy theories. She noted that YouTube could expand on that list over time.\n\nThis was all news to the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that administers the volunteer-edited Wikipedia. \u201cWe were not given advance notice of this announcement,\u201d the foundation said in a statement Wednesday, adding that there is no formal partnership between it and YouTube. While it did not explicitly object to YouTube using its content in this way, the nonprofit stressed that it relies on donors and unpaid editors, and that it \u201cdoes not control content or make editorial decisions about information that is included on Wikipedia.\u201d\n\nIn other words, an $800 billion company\u2014arguably the world\u2019s most important information source\u2014is outsourcing the job of combatting misinformation on its platform to a nonprofit built on free labor. And it didn\u2019t bother to tell them.\n\nEven if YouTube had handled this better, it\u2019s not clear that Wikipedia cards will do much to solve its problems. The approach is loosely analogous to one that Facebook began deploying in December 2016 to fight fake news. But Facebook later ditched its initial approach amid concerns that it might be backfiring (a finding that is itself disputed by some). After a year\u2019s worth of research, testing, and trial and error, there\u2019s been little evidence so far that the social network\u2019s efforts have made much difference in the spread of misinformation. That\u2019s one reason Facebook has simultaneously pursued several other avenues to improve the quality and credibility of news and information on its platform\u2014some more promising than others.\n\nOne rather glaring problem with YouTube\u2019s plan is that it seems ill-equipped to handle conspiracies that crop up rapidly in the wake of major news events such as the Parkland shooting. Those memes\u2014such as the one smearing Parkland survivor David Hogg as a \u201ccrisis actor\u201d\u2014are liable to make the rounds on YouTube well before they\u2019ve been authoritatively debunked on Wikipedia, let alone added to a master list of well-known conspiracies. Even with human moderators on hand, some of these conspiracy theories have scaled to the top of YouTube\u2019s prominent list of trending videos, and earned millions of views in the process, before being taken down.\n\nAnother issue: Wikipedia is vulnerable to trolls and propagandists, just as is any other platform that relies on the public to produce and curate content. It might become more so, now that people know Wikipedia holds the keys to YouTube\u2019s conspiracy-debunking apparatus, such as it is. One prominent Wikipedia editor was quick to warn that YouTube\u2019s misinformation problems run deeper than anything that could be solved by an \u201cirregularly updated *encyclopedia*.\u201d\n\n...huh.\n\n\n\n1) ok, seems fine. Hope they credit us appropriately\n\n2) I don't think YouTube can rely on our irregularly updated *encyclopedia* to solve its ranking algorithm/hate speech issue; ppl don't read refs.\n\n3) web 2.0 is wierd, man.\n\n\n\n/goes back to working on Wikipedia articles https://t.co/f9G1JZLTu2 \u2014 Phoebe Ayers (@phoebe_ayers) March 14, 2018\n\nOn the same day that Wojcicki was taking the stage in Austin on Tuesday to announce her big fix, a YouTube spokesperson was telling Vice News that the company had no idea why an InfoWars conspiracy video was topping its search results Monday for queries about the package explosions in Austin. The InfoWars video claimed, without evidence, that Antifa was a \u201cprime suspect\u201d in the bombings.\n\nIn the same speech, according to tweets by BuzzFeed News\u2019 Ryan Mac, Wired editor-in-chief Nick Thompson asked Wojcicki how YouTube decides which information sources are credible. Wojcicki declined to get specific, saying \u201cthere are usually complicated algorithms\u201d\u2014the sort of vague excuse that Facebook shopped for years before critics largely stopped buying it. She did suggest, however, that YouTube looks at the \u201cnumber of journalistic awards\u201d and \u201camount of traffic\u201d that various publishers have. If that\u2019s true, those are some awfully crude, extremely amateurish proxies\u2014more so even than Facebook\u2019s widely ridiculed publisher trust survey.\n\nIt appears, then, that YouTube is just beginning the journey of reckoning that Facebook was compelled by critics (and its own outraged employees) to undertake almost immediately after the 2016 election. Part of that journey will probably involve learning some humility: Just last month Wojcicki sniped at a media conference in California that Facebook \u201cshould get back to baby pictures,\u201d the implication being that it couldn\u2019t handle the grown-up responsibilities of a prominent news platform. One could imagine a similar dig at YouTube, perhaps swapping out baby pictures for cat videos.\n\nThe reality is that none of these platforms is going back to its comparatively innocent early days. Social media, for better or worse, has firmly established itself as a primary news source for huge swaths of the population, with younger generations leading that trend. That means YouTube, like Facebook and Twitter, is stuck with the responsibility of figuring out how to do a better job of informing its users. Excuses like the one Google\u2019s Richard Salgado offered to Congress in October\u2014that the company is a \u201ctechnology platform\u201d and therefore not in the news business\u2014no longer fly.\n\nIt\u2019s good to see YouTube finally beginning to acknowledge that it has a problem. The next step is for it to understand that solving that problem won\u2019t be easy, and quick fixes won\u2019t suffice. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg indicated in January that he understood fixing his platform will require a sustained, long-term effort. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said as much in a tweetstorm earlier this month.

The ground began to shake almost immediately after the alarm was triggered.\n\nA new algorithm was being tested for the SASMEX system at the time, which could, in the future, issue a warning 8-10 seconds earlier.\n\nSimilarly, Japanese seismologists have looked to improve their early warning system after the devastating 2011 M9 earthquake.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Japan 2011: Early warning systems gave residents a brief evacuation window\n\nDr Mitsuyuki Hoshiba, who has developed the new PLUM algorithm launched this week, explained. \"In PLUM method: strength of shaking is predicted directly from observed shaking, skipping the process of estimation of epicentre and magnitude.\"\n\nThis will, Dr Hoshiba says, reduce the problem of missed alarms for future earthquakes.\n\nThe big one\n\nBack in California, work continues on ShakeAlert.\n\nIt is due to have a limited public rollout later this year, supported by federal funding which was approved on Friday 23 March.\n\nThe system will use both ground-based seismometers and satellite observations to provide the maximum warning time to populations on the west coast.\n\nThe work done by Dr Minson and her colleagues shows that for San Francisco this may be about 50 seconds for minor shaking, or as little as eight seconds for a major earthquake.\n\nIf the system is to be as sensitive as possible, false alerts may also become a necessary part of life for Californians in the future.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption San Francisco is expected to experience a M6.5 earthquake within the next 30 years\n\nDr Cochran, who spent time in Mexico following the 2017 earthquakes, noted that \"people wanted as much information as they could get, and they were not particularly bothered as long as they heard there was an earthquake associated with that alert.\"\n\nDr Jones agrees: \"I do not believe that is a great shortcoming of early warning systems as long as it is understood... we need to invest in appropriate education for the general public about early warning for the information to be most effectively used.\"", "title": "How effective are earthquake early warning systems?"}, {"url": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180321141417.htm", "content": "A team of seismologists has developed a new measurement of seismic energy release that can be applied to large earthquakes. Called the Radiated Energy Enhancement Factor (REEF), it provides a measure of earthquake rupture complexity that better captures variations in the amount and duration of slip along the fault for events that may have similar magnitudes.\n\nMagnitude is a measure of the relative size of an earthquake. There are several different magnitude scales (including the original Richter scale), with the \"moment magnitude\" now the most widely used measure because it is uniformly applicable to all sizes of earthquakes. The seismic energy released in an earthquake can also be measured directly from recorded ground shaking, providing a distinct measure of the earthquake process. Earthquakes of a given magnitude can have very different radiated seismic energy.\n\nResearchers at UC Santa Cruz and California Institute of Technology (Caltech) devised REEF in an effort to understand variations in the rupture characteristics of the largest and most destructive earthquakes, such as the 2004 Sumatra earthquake (magnitude 9.2) and 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan (magnitude 9.1). They introduced the new measurement in a paper published March 21 in Science Advances. First author Lingling Ye, a former UC Santa Cruz graduate student and Caltech postdoctoral researcher, is now at the Sun Yat-sen University in China. Her coauthors are Hiroo Kanamori at Caltech and Thorne Lay at UC Santa Cruz.\n\nREEF is measured by the ratio of the earthquake's actual measured radiated energy (in seismic waves recorded around the world) to the minimum possible energy that an event of equal seismic moment and rupture duration would produce. If the rupture is jerky and irregular, it radiates more seismic energy, especially at high frequencies, and this indicates frictional conditions and dynamic processes on the fault plane during rupture, Lay explained.\n\nThe researchers made systematic measurements of REEF for 119 recent major earthquakes of magnitudes 7.0 to 9.2. They found clear regional patterns, with some subduction zones having higher REEF ruptures on average than other zones.\n\n\"This indicates, for the first time, that energy release is influenced by regional properties of each fault zone,\" said Lay, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UCSC.\n\nThe precise cause of some regions radiating higher energy in an event of given size is still under investigation, but may be linked to regional differences in the roughness of the faults, in the fluid distributions on the faults, or in the sediments trapped in the fault zone, he said.\n\nFurther research using REEF could help seismologists achieve better understanding of earthquake mechanics and earthquake hazards around the world.\n\nThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation of China, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and U.S. National Science Foundation.", "title": "Seismologists introduce new measure of earthquake ruptures -- ScienceDaily"}, {"url": "http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-earthquake-legislation-nazarian-20180313-story.html", "content": "\"Historically, we have had 'life safety' as the code minimum [in which] people would be able to exit and people shouldn't die in new buildings,\" said Janah Risha, president of the association. \"But if we look at economic survivability, it is not enough. \u2026 What happens to our whole regional economy when residential buildings cannot be reoccupied, when people cannot go into offices for an extended period of time?\"", "title": "California earthquake standard designed to save lives but not buildings.

Some drifts into large systems of circulating ocean currents, known as gyres. Once trapped in a gyre, the plastic will break down into microplastics, which may be ingested by sea life.\n\nThe message of the study is clear, said Laurent Lebreton.\n\n\"It goes back to how we use plastic,\" he said.\n\n\"We're not going to get away from plastic - in my opinion it's very useful, in medicine, transportation and construction, but I think we must divert the way we use plastic, particularly in terms of single-use plastic and those objects that have a very short service lifespan.\"\n\nFollow Helen on Twitter.", "title": "Plastic patch in Pacific Ocean growing rapidly, study shows"}, {"url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w", "content": "Sampling\n\nFrom July 27th to September 19th 2015, a total of 652 surface net tows were carried out between 25\u00b0N\u201341\u00b0N and 129\u2013156\u00b0W by 18 participating vessels. In October 2016, we revisited our study area by conducting two flights with a Hercules C-130 aircraft that collected aerial imagery (n = 7,298 single-frame mosaics) to better quantify the larger and rarer >50 cm plastic objects (Fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1 Field monitoring effort. Vessel (grey and dark blue lines) and aircraft (light blue lines) tracks and locations where data on buoyant ocean plastic concentrations were collected (circles). Grey circles (n = 350) represent areas sampled with a single Manta net tow by 17 participating vessels, between July and September 2015. Dark blue circles (n = 76) represent areas sampled with paired Manta and paired Mega net tows by RV Ocean Starr, between July and August 2015. Light blue circles (n = 31) show locations of RGB geo-referenced mosaics collected from a C-130 Hercules aircraft, in October 2016. This map was created using QGIS version 2.18.1 (www.qgis.org). Full size image\n\nVessels carried out net tows of 0.35\u20134 hours duration, while navigating at 0.7\u20136.8 knots. All trawls were designed to move away from the vessel to avoid wake effects on the capture efficiency of the devices. All vessel crews were trained with online material and one-to-one workshops that had been conducted prior to departure. While towing the trawl, the most experienced sailor aboard the vessel estimated the sea state (Beaufort scale) by measuring wind speeds and observing wave heights. This data was recorded in the standard datasheets provided, alongside the date, duration, as well as initial and final coordinates of each tow. The location and length of all net tows were confirmed during the post-processing phase by inspecting the position data from GPS trackers installed on all participating vessels. Most sampling stations encompassed a single net tow (n = 350 sampling stations) using a Manta trawl (0.5 mm square mesh, 90 cm \u00d7 15 cm mouth), which is one of the standard devices for quantifying plastic pollution levels. With the largest participating vessel (RV Ocean Starr), we simultaneously towed two Manta trawls, alongside two large Neuston trawls (1.5 cm square mesh, 6 m \u00d7 1.5 m mouth, of which 0.5 m above the water line; thereafter called \u2018Mega trawls\u2019) at every sampling location (n = 76 stations). After each Manta net tow, the net was rinsed from the outside with seawater, and its single-use cod-end removed, closed with staples and placed in an individual zip-lock bag. After each Mega trawl tow, the net was also rinsed from the outside with seawater and its large cod-end opened in a box filled with seawater. All buoyant plastics were then removed, wrapped in aluminium and placed in labelled plastic bags. The whole content captured by the Manta trawls was stored, while the organisms captured by the Mega trawls (mostly alive) were released back into the ocean. All samples were stored in a fridge or freezer while at-sea, and in a FedEx cool box (2\u20138 \u00b0C) or reefer (\u22122 \u00b0C) while being shipped to the laboratory. Even though we were careful when handling samples, some debris items may have been broken during transportation, leading to some bias in our debris size distribution. Detailed information related to these net tows (i.e. coordinates, metocean conditions, sampling times and durations) is provided in Figshare33.\n\nThe aerial surveys sampled a far greater area (311.0 km2) than the trawl surveys described above (3.9 km2 and 13.6 km2, for Manta and Mega net tows, respectively), thus yielding a more reliable quantification of debris larger than 50 cm, which are relatively rare. Both flights started and ended at Moffett Airfield near Mountain View, California. The first aerial survey was conducted on October 2nd 2016 sampling from 18:56 to 21:14 UTC time, at a constant latitude of 33.5\u00b0N, and longitudes varying from 141.4\u00b0W to 134.9\u00b0W. The second survey started on October 6th 2016 sampling from 22:14 to 0:37 UTC, from 30.1\u00b0N, 143.7\u00b0W to 32.9\u00b0N, 138.1\u00b0W. While in survey mode, the aircraft flew at an altitude of approximately 400 m and at a ground speed of 140 knots. Sampling transects targeted areas where the sea state conditions were the lowest, based on the weather forecast, including sea surface atmospheric pressure, cloud cover, wind speed at 10 m above sea level and boundary surface layer height provided by NOAA\u2019s Global Forecasting System, as well as significant wave height and peak period data distributed by NOAA\u2019s WaveWatch3 model outputs. Even though we surveyed floating debris using trained observers and three types of sensor (Lidar, SWIR imager, and RGB camera), here we only analyse information coming from the geo-referenced mosaics produced by a RGB camera (CS-4800i) that generally took photographs every second during surveying time (frame size = ~360 m across track, ~240 m along track, ~0.1 m resolution).\n\nTrawl samples processing\n\nTrawl samples were separately washed into a sieve tower (five Glenammer Engineering Ltd sieves, with 0.05 cm, 0.15 cm, 0.5 cm, 1.5 cm, and 5 cm square apertures) that divided the material into the following size classes: 0.05\u20130.15 cm, 0.15\u20130.5 cm, 0.5\u20131.5 cm, 1.5\u20135 cm, and >5 cm. Debris items >5 cm were then manually sorted into 5\u201310 cm, 10\u201350 cm, and >50 cm classes by measuring the object lengths (widest dimension of the object) with a ruler. Buoyant debris was separated from biomass by placing the material within each sieve in filtered saltwater (salinity 3.5%, temperature 19\u201323 \u00b0C). Lab personnel stirred the material many times to insure floating particles were detached from the biomass material. Floating objects identified as buoyant debris were manually extracted from the water surface using forceps, separated into types, and counted. Buoyant debris was classified into material type (plastic, glass, paraffin, tar, rubber, wood, pumice, seed or unknown), with plastics being further divided into the following categories: (1) \u2018H\u2019 type \u2013 fragments and objects made of hard plastic, plastic sheet or film; (2) \u2018N\u2019 type \u2013 plastic lines, ropes, and fishing nets; (3) \u2018P\u2019 type \u2013 pre-production plastic pellets in the shape of a cylinder, disk or sphere; and (4) \u2018F\u2019 type \u2013 fragments or objects made of foamed material (e.g. expanded polystyrene). Once counted and categorized, the pieces were washed with distilled water, transferred to aluminium dishes, dried overnight at 60 \u00b0C, and weighed using an OHAUS Explorer EX324M (0.0001 g readability) for objects <5 cm, and a OHAUS Explorer EX12001M (0.1 g readability) for objects >5 cm.\n\nTo best characterize the ocean plastic accumulating within the GPGP, we performed additional analyses with the material collected. Firstly, 10 pieces within each plastic size/type category (n = 220 pieces) were selected for polymer composition analysis by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The readings were done using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR equipped with a universal ATR accessory (range = 600\u20134000 cm\u22121). The respective polymer type was determined by comparing sample FT-IR spectra against known spectra from a database (Perkin-Elmer ATR of Polymers Library). Secondly, we screened all plastic debris collected for production dates, as well as any writings statements giving information on its origin (i.e. language and \u2018made in\u2019 statements). Lastly, we classified plastic items from \u2018H\u2019 and \u2018L\u2019 types collected at 30 RV Ocean Starr stations into object types (e.g. bottle lids, bags, bottles, etc). As \u2018H\u2019 objects larger than 50 cm were relatively rare, we analysed 10 extra RV Ocean Starr stations for this type/size category. If the object type of a fragment could not be determined, we classified the piece as either hard plastic fragment or film fragment depending on its wall thickness and flexibility34. We used Manta trawl samples to characterise objects within size classes 0.15\u20130.5 cm, 0.5\u20131.5 cm, and 1.5\u20135 cm, and Mega trawl samples to characterise objects within size classes 5\u201310 cm, 10\u201350 cm, and >50 cm. Plastics within our smallest size class (0.05\u20130.15 cm) were not considered in this \u2018Object Type\u2019 analysis due to the difficulty of handling and identifying small fragments.\n\nThe numerical/mass concentrations of buoyant plastic items (count/kg of plastic per km2 of sea surface) measured by each net tow were calculated for all plastic size/type categories separately. To do so, we divided the count and weight of plastic objects within each category by the towed area of the sample. We calculated the towed area by multiplying net mouth width (90 cm for Manta trawl, 6 m for Mega trawl) by tow length (determined from GPS position data). The average area covered by Manta net tows was 0.008 km2 (SD = 0.004, min\u2013max: 0.001\u20130.018 km2), while the average area covered by Mega net tows was 0.090 km2, (SD = 0.013, min\u2013max: 0.046\u20130.125 km2). As buoyant plastics can be missed by surface trawls due to wind-driven mixing, we then estimated the \u2018depth-integrated\u2019 mass and numerical plastic concentrations (Ci) for all type/size categories at each of the trawl sampling locations using the equations described in ref.35. Supplementary Methods 1 provides details on how Ci was calculated as a function of ocean plastic terminal rising velocity (Wb), depth sampled by the trawl, and sea state. It also describes how we measured Wb for each of the type/size categories of this study. After comparing plastic concentration results obtained by paired Manta and Mega net tows (n = 76 locations), we decided to use Manta and Mega trawl samples to quantify debris 0.05\u20135 cm and 5\u201350 cm in size, respectively. The comparison results and reasoning behind such decision in provided in Supplementary Methods 2.\n\nAerial imagery processing\n\nAll RGB images taken during our survey flights (n = 7,298) were georeferenced using accurate aircraft position and altitude data collected during the surveys. They were then inspected by two trained observers and a detection algorithm. Observers inspected all images at full-screen on a Samsung HD monitor (LU28E590DS/XY) and those single-frame mosaics containing debris were uploaded into QGIS software (Version 2.18.3\u2013Las Palmas) to record their position and characteristics. We trust we had a very small number of false positives and a high number of false negatives. This is because the observers took a conservative approach: they only logged features as debris when they were very confident with its identification. As such, many features that could be debris, but resembled other natural features, such as sun glint and breaking wave, were not logged into our ocean plastic dataset. Once this work was finalised, we ran an experimental algorithm capable of detecting potential debris in all our RGB mosaics as a quality control step. To avoid any false positives, all features detected by the algorithm were also visually inspected by an observer and only those visually identified as debris were logged in our QGIS database. For every sighting, we recorded position (latitude, longitude), length (widest dimension of the object), width, and object type: (1) \u2018bundled net\u2019 \u2013 a group of fishing nets bundled tightly together; they are commonly colourful and of a rounded shape; (2) \u2018loose net\u2019 \u2013 a single fishing net; they were generally quite translucent and rectangular in shape; (3) \u2018container\u2019 \u2013 rectangular and bright objects, such as fishing crates and drums; (4) \u2018rope\u2019 \u2013 long cylindrical objects around 15 cm thick; (5) \u2018buoy/lid\u2019, rounded bright objects that could be either a large lid or a buoy; (6) \u2018unknown\u2019 \u2013 objects that are clearly debris but whose object type was not identified, they were mostly irregular-shaped items resembling plastic fragments; and (7) Other \u2013 only one object was successfully identified but did not belong to any category above: a life ring. We recorded 1,595 debris items (403 and 1,192 in flights 1 and 2 respectively); 626 were 10\u201350 cm and 969 were >50 cm in length. Most of them were classified as \u2018unknown\u2019 (78% for 10\u201350 cm, 32% for >50 cm), followed by \u2018buoy or lid\u2019 (20%) and \u2018bundled net\u2019 (1%) for 10\u201350 cm debris, and by \u2018bundled net\u2019 (29%), \u2018container\u2019 (18%), \u2018buoy or lid\u2019 (9%), \u2018rope\u2019 (6%), and \u2018lose net\u2019 (4%) for >50 cm debris. To calculate ocean plastic concentrations, we grouped the geo-referenced images into 31 ~10 km2 mosaics. For numerical concentrations, we simply divided the number of debris pieces 10\u201350 cm and >50 cm within each mosaic by the area covered. To estimate mass concentrations, we had to first estimate the mass of each object spotted, then we separately summed the mass of 10\u201350 cm and >50 cm debris within each mosaic by the area covered. More information on how we estimated the mass of each spotted objects is provided in Supplementary Methods 3.\n\nNumerical model formulation\n\nOcean plastic pathways can be represented by Lagrangian particle trajectories31. In our framework, particles were advected by the following environmental drivers: sea surface currents, wave induced Stokes drift and winds. Starting from identical particle releases, we produced a series of forcing scenarios to represent the diversity in shape and composition of ocean plastics. Starting from using sea surface current only, we gradually added forcing terms representing the actions of atmospheric drag and wind waves on buoyant debris. The action of wind was simulated by considering the displacement of particles as a fraction of wind speed at 10 m above sea level. This is referred as the \u2018windage coefficient\u2019. We assessed different windage coefficient scenarios including 0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 2% and 3%. We sourced global sea surface currents (1993 to 2012) from the HYCOM + NCODA global 1/12\u00b0 reanalysis (experiment 19.0 and 19.136,37,38), and wind (10 m above sea level) speed and direction data (1993 to 2012) from NCEP/NCAR global reanalysis39. Wave induced Stokes drift amplitude was calculated using wave spectrum bulk coefficients (significant wave height, peak wave period and direction) from Wavewatch3 model outputs40.\n\nFor every forcing scenario, particles were identically and continuously released in time from 1993 to 2012 following spatial distributions and amplitudes of significant ocean plastic sources on land (coastal population hotspots23 and major rivers24) as well as at sea (fishing26,41, aquaculture42 and shipping industries43). Source scenarios were combined using relative source contribution as well as geographical distribution presented in Supplementary Methods 4. We advected global particles in time using the forcing scenarios described above and successfully reproduced the formation of oceanic garbage patches, with the shape and gradient of particle concentrations in these areas differing amongst forcing scenarios. We computed daily particle visits over 0.2\u00b0 resolution grids corresponding to our observation domain and extending from 160\u00b0W to 120\u00b0W in longitude and 20\u00b0N to 45\u00b0N in latitude. The number of daily particle visits was uniformized over the total number of particles present in the global model at a given time. The model-predicted non-dimensional concentration \u03b4 i of cell i, was calculated as follows:\n\n\u03b4 i = \u2211 s \u03b1 s \u03b4 i , s (1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 s is the non-dimensional weight relative to the contribution of source s and \u03b4 i,s is the percentage of global particles from source s in cell i. \u03b4 i,s is calculated with the number of particles n i,s from source s in cell i over the total number of global particles \u03a3 i n s from source s:\n\n\u03b4 i , s = n i , s \u2211 i n s (2)\n\nNumerical model calibration\n\nWe collected measurements at sea in 2015 and 2016, but our numerical model uses ocean circulation reanalysis covering the period from 1993 to 2012. Modelled ocean circulation data post-2012 is available from HYCOM however not as a reanalysis product. As such, we decided not to use it in this study. As initial model particles released in 1993 significantly start to accumulate in the area after about 7 years, we averaged uniformized daily particle visits over 12 years, from 2000 to 2012. We grouped observed debris size classes in four categories: microplastics (0.05\u20130.5 cm), mesoplastics (0.5\u20135 cm), macroplastics (5\u201350 cm) and megaplastics (>50 cm). We compared model predictions against depth-integrated microplastic concentrations as this dataset collected by Manta trawls had the largest spatial coverage. Mass concentrations derived from trawl measurements were grouped in 0.2-degree resolution cells and compared against model-predicted non-dimensional concentration \u03b4 for the five different forcing scenarios. The best model fit was found for the forcing scenario with sea-surface current only (R2 = 0.52, n = 277 cells). The regression coefficient declined as we increased the atmospheric drag term (R2 = 0.39 to 0.21 depending on windage coefficient).\n\nAs we analysed the accumulation of model particles in the GPGP region, we noticed significant seasonal and inter-annual variations of the GPGP position. The modelled GPGP dimensions was relatively consistent throughout our 12 years of analysis, but the relative position of this accumulation zone varied with years and seasons. We first decided to test our model for seasonal variation by comparing our microplastic concentrations (measured in July \u2013 September 2015) against modelled concentrations averages for the July\u2013September periods of 2000 to 2012. This comparison yielded poorer results (R2 = 0.46 to 0.21, depending on forcing scenario) than with the 12 years average solution (R2 = 0.52) as the July\u2013September GPGP position varied substantially among years.\n\nThe relation between the accumulation of marine debris in the North Pacific and climate events such as El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has previously been discussed18. As such, to account for inter-annual variation, we compared latitudinal and longitudinal position of the GPGP against these two climate indexes: ENSO and PDO. We found that 2002 and 2004 were similar to the conditions experienced during our multi-vessel expedition. Thus, we compared our measurements against particle visit averages for July\u2013September of 2002 and 2004 combined. This second attempt exhibited better results (R2 = 0.58 to 0.41, depending on forcing scenario), suggesting that climatic events such as ENSO or PDO influence the average position of the GPGP. Therefore, we decided to use the July\u2013September average for 2002 and 2004, which better accounts for inter-annual variations in the GPGP position. More information on the selection of years for calibrating the model against trawl and aerial surveys data is provided in Supplementary Methods 5. The best fit between model predictions and microplastic observations was found once again for the forcing scenario with sea surface current only (R2 = 0.58, n = 277). The best regression fit between measured and modelled microplastic concentrations had a = \u22128.3068 and b = 0.6770 in the parametric formulation:\n\nc m o d = 10 log 10 \u03b4 \u2212 a b (3)\n\nFrom this formulation, we computed the modelled microplastics mass concentration in our domain area and extracted contour levels by order of magnitude, from 0.01 g km\u22122 to 10 kg km\u22122. The GPGP as defined in this study corresponds to the 1 kg km\u22122 microplastic mass concentration level covering an area of 1.6 million km2 and depicted as a bold line in Fig. 2a. As a validation, we categorized microplastics measurements inside and outside the 1 kg km\u22122 contour line (Fig. 2b). For stations inside the model-predicted GPGP, the median measured microplastic concentration was 1.8 kg km\u22122 (25th\u201375th percentiles = 3.5\u20130.9 kg km\u22122) while for stations outside, the median was 0.3 kg km\u22122 (25th\u201375th percentiles = 0.2\u20130.7 kg km\u22122). Using our calibrated microplastics distribution, we computed the mass and numerical concentration for individual size classes from scaling modelled concentrations by the ratio between average modelled microplastics distribution inside the GPGP and averaged measured concentrations per size class of stations inside the patch. A comparison between measured and modelled mass/numerical concentrations for all ocean plastic size classes is given in Fig. 2c and d.\n\nFigure 2 Numerical model calibration. (a) The GPGP boundary (blue line) is estimated by comparing microplastic concentration measurements (circles) to model particle visit averages that accounted for seasonal and inter-annual variations. This map was created using QGIS version 2.18.1 (www.qgis.org). (b) Model validation showing median measured mass concentration for microplastics of stations outside and inside our predicted 1 kg km\u22122 GPGP boundary. Bars extend from 25th to 75th percentile while whiskers extend to minimum and maximum non-outlier. Outliers are represented as crosses. (c) Measured mass concentrations versus modelled mass concentrations for microplastics, mesoplastics, macroplastics and megaplastics. (d) Same as (c) but with numerical concentrations. Full size image\n\nOur confidence intervals were formulated to account for uncertainties in both sampling and modelling. For the trawl collection (i.e. micro-, meso- and macroplastics), we considered uncertainties related to the vertical-mixing corrections applied to surface concentrations using reported sea state and plastic\u2019s rising velocities (see Supplementary Methods 1). For the aerial mosaics, we accounted for uncertainties related to estimating the mass of sighted objects based on correlations between top-view area and dry weight of objects collected in the trawls (see Supplementary Methods 3). Finally, to account for modelling uncertainties, we added (respectively subtracted) the standard error of measured concentration to (resp. from) the mean upper (resp. lower) mass concentration when scaling the microplastics distribution to individual size classes.\n\nCharacterisation by types, sources and forcing scenarios\n\nThe total estimated mass load of ocean plastic in the GPGP by size classes were further divided by types. We calculated the average fraction in mass of individual ocean plastic types per sampling event for stations inside the patch (Supplementary Table 1) and derived the contribution of types \u2018H\u2019, \u2018N\u2019, \u2018F\u2019 and \u2018P\u2019. Further, as we predominantly observed debris originated from marine sources, we investigated the source contribution predicted by our calibrated modelled distribution. For individual model cells, we calculated the percentage of Lagrangian particle visits from individual sources. As initial particles were weighted in accordance to estimated global inputs, model particles from marine sources originally represented 28.1% of the total amount of material with fishing (17.9%), aquaculture (1.3%) and shipping (8.9%). We calculated the difference from this initial percentage value for each model cell and reported it to the predicted total mass concentration. In doing so, we defined \u2018anomalies\u2019 in marine source contribution in the North Pacific and expressed these in unit of mass per surface area. Finally, even though our calibrated model considered sea surface current only, we compared the predominance of forcing scenarios by evaluating the respective number of particle visits for each model cells. We computed contours around the GPGP for individual forcing scenarios in a way that the material contained inside each contour is equal to our initial forcing scenario (i.e. sea surface current only).\n\nThe dependence of the particle trajectory on the windage coefficient predicted by our model is in good agreement with sightings and modelling of debris originated from the 2011 Tohoku tsunami in Japan44,45. The first identified Japanese debris items that arrived after 10 to 12 months on the North American shores were objects with high windage such as buoys, boats and floating docks. Debris also arrived on Hawaiian Islands 18 months after the incident. The time of arrival was closely related to object types, starting in the first year with large oyster farm buoys and other floats, containers, and canisters. In the second year more buoys, tipped boats, fridges, and pallets arrived, followed later by timber beams and wooden debris. Our model predicted that only objects with a windage coefficient above 3% could arrive on Hawaii in the second year after the 2011 tsunami. Objects with windage coefficient ranging from 1 to 2% would reach Hawaii during the third year, while objects with no windage would mostly accumulate in the GPGP, north east of the archipelago.\n\nLong term analysis\n\nThe definition of a dynamic GPGP boundary that accounts for seasonal and inter-annual variabilities allowed us to estimate which sea surface trawl data points from the literature are inside or outside the GPGP region. Therefore, we used our calibrated model to assess the decadal evolution of microplastic mass concentrations (kg km\u22122) within and around the GPGP. Concentration data from the literature (Supplementary Table 2) was obtained from published datasets or digitized from figures when not available digitally17,46,47. When data was reported in unit of mass per volume of water48, we used the net tow depth to calculate the concentration per surface area unit. When only numerical concentration was reported22,48, we estimated mass concentration by using the average ocean plastic mass from net tows where both mass and numerical concentrations were reported (m = 3.53 mg, SE: 0.10 mg, n = 872).\n\nWe compared the model-predicted GPGP boundary with the locations of samples collected between 1999 and 201221,22,48,49. Samples collected before 199917,46,47,48 were compared against the GPGP position estimated for the sampled months and years in the 1999\u20132012 period that had similar ENSO and PDO values (See Supplementary Methods 6). Using our dynamic GPGP model boundary as reference, we classified each net tow into 3 categories: (1) sampled within the GPGP boundary, (2) sampled outside the GPGP boundary, but above 20\u00b0N and below 45\u00b0N and (3) sampled in the rest of the North Pacific. We only used net tows from the first two categories above so that concentration statistics for outside the patch were not biased by measurements taken in equatorial and polar waters, where concentrations were very low. We then grouped these microplastic concentration observations from plankton net trawls by decades, taking data recorded between 1965\u20131974 (n = 20 inside and n = 58 outside17,48), 1975\u20131984 (n = 0 inside and n = 19 outside46), 1985\u20131994 (n = 4 inside and n = 2 outside47), 1995\u20132004 (n = 2 inside and n = 252 outside22,49), 2005\u20132014 (n = 195 inside and n = 861 outside21,22,48) and finally 2015 (n = 288 inside and n = 213 outside; this study). We calculated the mean (\u00b1 standard error) of measured microplastic mass concentration per decades for within and around the GPGP boundary. Finally, we extracted decadal trends by fitting an exponential function (R2 = 0.94) assuming null concentrations at the beginning of the 20th century. The exponential fit exhibited better results than linear, quadratic or cubic functions (R2 = 0.71, R2 = 0.86 and R2 = 0.91, respectively).", "title": "Evidence that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is rapidly accumulating plastic"}, {"url": "https://www.theoceancleanup.com/press/great-pacific-garbage-patch-growing-rapidly-study-shows/", "content": "This site makes use of third-party cookies for analytics.

(Photo: The Ocean Cleanup)\n\nThe world's largest collection of ocean garbage is growing.\n\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a collection of plastic, floating trash halfway between Hawaii and California, has grown to more than 600,000 square miles, a study published Thursday found. That's twice the size of Texas.\n\nWinds and converging ocean currents funnel the garbage into a central location, said study lead author Laurent Lebreton of the Ocean Cleanup Foundation, a non-profit organization that spearheaded the research.\n\nFirst discovered in the early 1990s, the trash in the patch comes from around the Pacific Rim, including nations in Asia and North and South America, Lebreton said.\n\nThe patch is not a solid mass of plastic. It includes about 1.8 trillion pieces and weighs 88,000 tons \u2014 the equivalent of 500 jumbo jets. The new figures are as much as 16 times higher than previous estimates.\n\nThe research \u2014 the most complete study undertaken of the garbage patch \u2014 was published Thursday in the peer-reviewed journal Scientific Reports.\n\n\"We were surprised by the amount of large plastic objects we encountered,\u201d said Julia Reisser of the foundation. \u201cWe used to think most of the debris consists of small fragments, but this new analysis shines a new light on the scope of the debris.\"\n\nThe study was based on a three-year mapping effort by an international team of scientists affiliated with the Ocean Cleanup Foundation, six universities and an aerial sensor company.\n\nMore: Our trash harms the deepest fish in the ocean\n\nMore: Humans have produced 18.2 trillion pounds of plastic since the '50s. That's equal in size to 1 billion elephants.\n\nSadly, the Pacific patch isn't alone. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is the largest of five such trash collections in the ocean, Lebreton said.\n\nCLOSE This video shows the devastating plastic waste that is overtaking the waters near Bali. Buzz60\n\nScientists work with the European Space Agency to take photos of the garbage patches from space.\n\nNo governments have stepped up to clean the trash, which is in international waters, so it's up to privately funded groups such as the Ocean Cleanup Foundation to take the lead in getting rid of the garbage.\n\nThere's a sense of urgency, said Joost Dubois, a spokesman with the foundation.\n\n\"It's a ticking time bomb of larger material,\" Dubois said. \"We've got to get it before it breaks down into a size that's too small to collect and also dangerous for marine life.\"\n\nSince plastic has been around only since the 1950s, there's no way of knowing exactly how long it will last in the ocean. If left alone, the plastic could remain there for decades, centuries or even longer.\n\n\"Unless we begin to remove it, some would say it may remain there forever,\" Lebreton said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2GeRHO8", "title": "Pacific garbage patch, largest collection of ocean trash, grows"}, {"url": "https://gizmodo.com/the-great-pacific-garbage-patch-has-way-more-trash-insi-1823983852", "content": "Photo: The Ocean Cleanup\n\nFor years, scientists have been tracking a large accumulation of floating trash, mostly bits of plastic, in the north Pacific ocean called the \u201cGreat Pacific Garbage Patch,\u201d or the \u201ctrash vortex.\u201d This region, according to the latest research, has more lost and discarded plastic inside it than previous surveys suggested\u2014like, a lot more. And it\u2019s still growing.\n\n\n\nThe Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) is filled with 79,000 metric tonnes (87,000 tons) of plastic, which is between 10 to 16 times higher than previous estimates, according to new research published today in Scientific Reports. Disturbingly, plastic pollution inside the GPGP \u201cis increasing exponentially and at a faster rate than in surrounding waters,\u201d the authors state in the paper. For the many marine animals that make this vast ocean region their home, this is a dreadful development.\n\nImage: The Ocean Cleanup\n\nA popular misconception of the GPGP is that it\u2019s a gigantic floating island of plastic. In reality, it\u2019s a region of the north Pacific ocean, from Hawaii to California, that extends for 1.6 million square kilometers (618,000 square miles). In this region, floating garbage gets trapped by wind and ocean currents, where it\u2019s been steadily accumulating for decades. Looking at this region from a boat or plane, an observer wouldn\u2019t see very much or think that it\u2019s very polluted, but on closer inspection, the overall density of plastic garbage floating within it is high enough to warrant its designation as an area and phenomenon of concern. The new study, led by Laurent Lebreton from The Ocean Cleanup Foundation, was an effort to quantify and characterize the trash found within this major oceanic \u201cplastic pollution hotspot,\u201d also known as an oceanic gyre.\n\n\n\n\u201cPlastic accumulates in this region because of converging currents and low sea surface wind,\u201d Lebreton explained to Gizmodo. \u201cThis is a natural phenomenon that occurs in subtropical waters of every oceanic basins in the world. There are actually four other accumulation zones such as this one: South Pacific, North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Indian Ocean.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: The Ocean Cleanup\n\nFrom July 27th to September 19th, 2015, Lebreton\u2019s team surveyed the GPGP using aerial surveys and data collected by 652 nets pulled by 18 ships. The aerial images offered a more accurate assessment of the debris than previous surveys, which relied exclusively on visual surveys taken from boats.\n\n\n\nPhoto: The Ocean Cleanup\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPlastics were by far the most dominant type of marine litter found, representing more than 99.9% of the 1,136,145 pieces and 668 kg [1,473 lbs] of floating debris collected by our trawls,\u201d write the authors in the new study. Over three-quarters of the collected plastic was larger than two inches (5 cm), and nearly half came from fishing nets. Microplastics, measuring less than five millimeters in length (about the size of a sesame seed), represented 8 percent of the total mass of the GPGP\u2014but microplastics account for a whopping 94 percent of the estimated 1.8 trillion pieces of floating debris within the patch.\n\n\u201cWe knew most pieces are comprised of microplastics; however, when you look at the total available mass of plastic, most material is contained in large debris that may degrade into harmful microplastics over time,\u201d said Lebreton.\n\nClaudia Halsband, a senior scientist at Akvaplan Niva who isn\u2019t affiliated with the new study, says this observation make sense\u2014that the smaller the size range that is included in such surveys, the more particles are found. \u201cThis is expected as one piece of macroplastics can degrade into thousands if not millions of microplastics, hence the discrepancy between their contribution to mass versus abundance,\u201d she told Gizmodo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly certain types of plastic can float and collect within the patch, namely polyethylene and polypropylene, which are typically used in packaging. Most of the plastic had broken down into indistinguishable bits and pieces, but items that were identifiable included containers, bottles, lids, packaging straps, ropes, and fishing nets. Some items even had the date of production stamped onto them, the oldest dating all the way back to the 1970s.\n\nPhoto: The Ocean Cleanup\n\nDisturbingly, the estimates of plastic within the patch may actually be too low.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe used conservative methods whether in sampling or modelling during our research,\u201d Lebreton told Gizmodo. \u201cFor instance, take the aerial expedition data, when we were not sure if a spotted debris was plastic or something else (e.g. organic debris, wave chops, sun glints or marine life), we decided not to log the sighting so we were conservative.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of why the new estimate was so much higher than those produced by previous surveys, the researchers say it likely has to do with improved survey techniques, but also increasing levels of ocean plastic pollution. Each year, anywhere from 5 million to 19 million tonnes (5.5 to 20.1 million tons) of plastic is dumped, either intentionally in inadvertently, into the ocean. The spike may also have something to do with the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which washed an estimated 4.5 million tonnes (5 million tons) of debris into the ocean in an instant, of which 70 percent may have sunk rapidly to the bottom. The next steps for the researchers, and others concerned with this growing patch, is to figure out the primary sources of all this ocean plastic, and to determine how long plastics stay with the area.\n\n\u201cThis is an impressive and important study,\u201d Matthew Savoca, a postdoctoral researcher at NOAA\u2019s Southwest Fisheries Science Center, told Gizmodo. \u201cI have been hearing whispers about this study for awhile now, so I was excited to read it, and it did not disappoint.\u201d Savoca said the new results were \u201csad but not terribly surprising\u201d when considering the team\u2019s thorough approach to measuring large plastic debris at such an enormous scale. \u201cCounterintuitively, larger plastic has been more difficult to quantify than microplastics in the open ocean, so this study fills an important knowledge gap in that respect,\u201d he said.\n\nNeedless to say, the size and density of the GPGP is bad news for marine life, as animals like sea turtles and marine mammals can get tangled up in abandoned fishing gear and starve or drown\u2014a phenomenon known as \u201cghost fishing.\u201d Based on the new data, Savoca says this is a more serious threat to ocean life than previously considered. Another problem is that \u201chundreds of species of marine wildlife consume plastic, which has negative effects on those animals including malnutrition and biomagnification of plastic-derived toxicants,\u201d said Savoca. This could eventually be a concern for human health if we start to eat fish that have consumed plastic. \u201cFinally, more recent studies suggest that plastics may harbor pathogens and introduce disease to wildlife that is immunologically unprepared for this microscopic onslaught,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a biologist, Halsband said she\u2019s most concerned about the smallest particles, \u201cnot only because they are the most abundant, but because they interact with the smallest organisms at the base of marine food webs (such as zooplankton), and the potential for a magnification of the impacts up the food chain is high,\u201d she told Gizmodo.\n\nWhile discouraging, Savoca says there is a silver lining to the study.\n\n\u201cAs with CFCs and the ozone hole in the 1980s, with this issue\u2014plastics in the ocean\u2014we have identified the problem, the cause, and potential solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are things people can do everyday to help mitigate this issue, including supporting environmentally friendly legislation and reducing your own dependency on single-use plastics.\u201d For example, we can politely refuse plastic straws in restaurants, plastic cups on airplanes, or plastic coffee lids at Starbucks. \u201cWho needs that stuff anyway!\u201d said Savoca.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Scientific Reports]", "title": "The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Has Way More Trash Inside It Than We Thought"}, {"url": "://story/d2bqL6OPGQ7XyIMQNM_KHiPD2UIEM?ned=us", "content": "", "title": ""}, {"url": "http://www.times-standard.com/article/NJ/20180314/LOCAL1/180319903", "content": "Sunday marked seven years since a magnitude 9.1 earthquake spawned a tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region of Japan. It\u2019s an in-between remembering, halfway between the major memorial activities of five years and the decade one. The date was recognized by a smattering of articles, mainly in the Japanese press, noting progress in the ongoing struggle to recover. For the coastal cities and towns in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures, it has been a time once again to remember all that was lost.\n\nI visited Miyagi and Iwate on a post-tsunami reconnaissance effort in 2011. I arrived in Japan six weeks after the earthquake, as soon as the State Department allowed scientists to travel to the affected area. I spent 10 days with colleague and friend Megumi Sugimoto, a tsunami researcher who was then at Tokyo University, visiting some of the hardest hit areas to study factors that had exacerbated or reduced impacts. Today is a good time to revisit three of them and underscore that the disaster did not end when the waves receded on March 11. It continues to this day.\n\n\u2022 Yuriagi, a town just north of the Sendai Airport. A portion of my notes from May 4, 2011: \u201cThen out to the hardest hit area \u2014 the extremely flat land within a half-mile of the coast. This was the most devastated area we\u2019ve seen yet. Water heights in this region exceeded 30 feet and more than 1,000 people died. Whole blocks were leveled with an occasional structure partially standing. One woman commented while picking through the debris at her home site, \u2018Isn\u2019t this interesting, but it isn\u2019t ours so we shouldn\u2019t take it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nToday, Yuriage is still largely empty, but disaster reconstruction projects are beginning to move forward. The land has been artificially raised about seven feet above the old ground level and the construction of new roads and dwellings has begun but almost no residents have returned. This is part of the larger problem to permanently resettle evacuees. The government estimates that about 75,000 people are still in temporary housing throughout the tsunami-affected area.\n\n\u2022 Minamisanriku, 45 miles northeast of Yuiage on Shizugawa Bay. My notes from May 6, 2011:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA particularly tragic story played out at the city\u2019s Disaster Prevention Center. Keri Luna, a city official kept at the microphone announcing to the public that a tsunami was coming. Until she was finally overwhelmed. Of the 30 people on the fourth floor of the building, only 10 survived. Her body was found only a few days ago. Perhaps the saddest part of the story is that the building is only a five minutes walk from high ground and if everyone had headed to the hill instead of the building, they all would have survived.\u201d\n\nThe Disaster Prevention Center in Minamisanriku became one of the most widely photographed images of the disaster. The three-story steel-frame structure was built to resist strong earthquake shaking and intended to be the nerve center of the disaster response in the town. My most recent visit to the town was in November 2013 on the day that memorial ceremonies were being held before its scheduled demolition the next day. The demolition never took place, the prefecture stepping in to maintain the site until 2031, when the community may again be allowed to consider what to do with it. The fate of this building illustrates the conflicts between local and regional government and the issues of what should be preserved as a memorial. For the people of Minamisanriku, it is a constant reminder of what went wrong in 2011 and all the people who were lost.\n\n\u2022 Rikuzentakata, 45 miles north-northeast of Minamisanriku on Hirota Bay. Notes from May 7, 2011:\n\n\u201cRikuzentakata is the southernmost city in Iwate Prefecture. It sits on a flat plane at the end of an elongate bay that appeared to funnel the tsunami three to four miles inland up narrowing river valleys. It made me think of Orick and the mouth of Redwood Creek with about 23,000 more people. The sea walls were obliterated. Wood frame buildings were obliterated. Steel frame buildings were obliterated. The only structures left standing were reinforced concrete, and if you were lucky enough to be in one of those, you needed to be on the fifth floor or higher to survive.\u201d\n\nIn those early days right after the disaster, Rikuzentakata made efforts to communicate its situation with the rest of the world. I started following its Facebook page soon after so that I could learn about the recovery process. Two years later, I would use that Facebook page to connect with Amya Miller and the city after the boat belonging to the high school was found in Crescent City. That began a connection between Crescent City and Rikuzentakata that has become stronger with the years, leading to a sister school relationship and a sister city that is expected to become final this year.\n\nThe 2011 Japan tsunami didn\u2019t just impact Japan. The tsunami caused damage in many areas of the Pacific. In Northern California, Citizen\u2019s Dock in Crescent City was destroyed and Noyo Harbor in Fort Bragg suffered significant damage. The only death from the tsunami outside of Japan was a man swept out to sea from the mouth of the Klamath River: Dustin Douglas Weber, 25.\n\nOn March 28, Del Norte, Humboldt and Mendocino counties will conduct a Tsunami Warning Test as part of our preparedness efforts for the next tsunami that comes to our coast from far away. More about that in next week\u2019s column.\n\nNote: Complete blog posts from the 2011 Japan trip and previous reconnaissance trips are posted at http://www2.humboldt.edu/rctwg/blog.\n\nLori Dengler is an emeritus professor of geology at Humboldt State University and an expert in tsunami and earthquake hazards.

One of the big decisions to come out of the process was a plan for beefing up old concrete structures and \u201csoft story\u201d apartment buildings.\n\nJones said she found that preparedness is an easier sell if civic leaders can think not only about how to deal with the immediate aftermath of an earthquake, but also about how to keep their cities running long after the earth stops shaking.\n\n\u201cBy emphasizing financial outcomes rather than life safety outcomes, we kept people away from the fear that makes them not want to think about it,\u201d Jones explained. \u201cIt became a discussion of, \u2018When do you want to spend this money? Do you spend the money before, or do you spend after?'\u201d\n\nLlke California, the Pacific Northwest has a potential earthquake problem \u2014 largely due to the offshore Cascadia Fault that has the potential to produce a devastating magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami.\n\nExactly how devastating? Jones said it\u2019s possible to overestimate the threat.\n\nFor example, a New Yorker article titled \u201cThe Really Big One\u201d caused a scare in 2015 by stating that a Cascadia quake could turn everything west of Interstate 5 to toast. The way Jones sees it, the worst-case scenario for California\u2019s San Andreas Fault would be worse than a worst-case Cascadia quake, in part because the San Andreas fault runs right through a heavily populated area rather than offshore.\n\nBut it\u2019s also possible to underestimate the threat, and Jones suspects that\u2019s more likely to be the case for folks in the Pacific Northwest than for Californians.\n\nYou\u2019ve got a really big earthquake with a lot less smaller ones to help motivate you along the way.\n\nEven in L.A., it was a struggle to get policymakers, businesses and building owners on board with retrofitting and the \u201cResilience by Design\u201d program, Jones said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the same issue, and you\u2019ve got to deal with it with less earthquakes,\u201d she told the Seattle crowd. \u201cUntil this program, every significant seismic legislation in California has happened after we killed people in an earthquake. So that just puts you at a horrible disadvantage, because you\u2019ve got a really big earthquake [to come] with a lot less smaller ones to help motivate you along the way.\u201d\n\nFor year, experts have been recommending measures to force retrofits for more than 1,100 unreinforced brick and stone buildings in Seattle, plus thousands of buildings elsewhere in Washington state. Those recommendations, however, are still stuck in legislative limbo.\n\nWill it take a Really Big One to spur action? Jones is hopeful that Seattle, and other cities facing unseen earthquake risks, can learn from the misfortunes of others in an increasingly connected world.\n\n\u201cFor you guys to hear, \u2018OK, we\u2019ve got an earthquake and tsunami risk\u2019 \u2026 what does that really mean?\u201d Jones said. \u201cYou can go and watch what happened in Japan in 2011 and know what it means. That gives you a story. It gives you an emotional connection. It makes it more worthwhile moving on that.\u201d\n\nWorried about the Really Big One?

It seems that just yesterday, it was the only UC and the beloved Campanile didn\u2019t even exist (we at the Clog remember that sort of stuff). The past 150 years have been filled with some incredible inventions, Nobel Peace prizes, Big Games, campus expansions and being the No. 1 public university in the world. There\u2019s a reason UC Berkeley is so well known, and we\u2019ve decided to compile a list of things that have happened in every decade of its existence. There\u2019s no way we could possibly get every contribution to society the school made into one succinct list, but we\u2019ve compiled some of the highlights!\n\n1860s\n\nOn March 23, 1868, UC Berkeley was born! It\u2019s pretty obvious, but if that hadn\u2019t happened, where would we be? Another UC? Probably not, because without UC Berkeley, none of the others would exist. So you\u2019re welcome for our existence, California.\n\n1870s\n\nIn 1868, only men were allowed to apply to our school. Yet in 1870, women were allowed to apply and enroll as well, thereby gaining equal status to that of men! UC Berkeley has been \u201cwoke\u201d almost since its very beginning, which is pretty cool. The 1870s were also pretty great because The Daily Californian was founded in 1871!\n\n1880s\n\nCalifornia is known for its earthquakes, as many of us know from all the times we had to crawl under the desks in elementary school for drills. But before any of us were born and felt our first earthquake, professors in the earth sciences department set up the Western Hemisphere\u2019s very first seismographic stations in 1887. Soon after, UC Berkeley got the first reported record of an earthquake in 1887!\n\n1890s\n\nThe first Big Game was played against Stanford in 1892, and spoiler alert: We lost 14 to 10! But it\u2019s fine \u2014 there were many more Big Games to come, and a few (emphasis on a few) wins to boot.\n\n1900s\n\nThe Big C was built in 1905, which is a pretty big milestone for us students. This iconic Berkeley landmark is home to many sunset and late night hikes, but most of all, great memories.\n\n1910s\n\nEveryone\u2019s favorite tower, the Campanile, was built in 1914! The turn of the century was clearly a good time for Berkeley landmarks. From 1914 onward, the Campanile has been keeping time and entertaining students with its bells.\n\n1920s\n\nIn 1924, Joel Hildebrand came up with a mixture of helium and oxygen to protect deep-sea divers from getting the \u201cbends.\u201d This discovery opened up a whole lot more of the ocean for study. But don\u2019t put UC Berkeley\u2019s contributions to ocean exploration away just yet, because just like the vast ocean, there\u2019s more to unearth.\n\n1930s\n\nRobert Gordon Sproul was appointed as president of the university. If you don\u2019t live under a rock, you\u2019ll probably recognize his name from Sproul Hall and Sproul Plaza. He oversaw UC Berkeley during the Great Depression by seeking private funds to keep research and UC Berkeley\u2019s academic rigor going.\n\n1940s\n\nUC Berkeley\u2019s contributions to science have changed the world for the better, but also, it can be argued, for the worse. In the 1940s, both the flu vaccine and atomic bomb were invented during World War II. The UC and professor J. Robert Oppenheimer actually directed operations at the labs in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where the atomic bomb was developed and tested.\n\n1950s\n\nLook, we\u2019re going to talk about the ocean again! In 1952, wetsuits were invented by physics professor Hugh Bradner! Thanks to him, we can explore the depths of the sea and surf without getting too cold. He made underwater exploration possible, and you can now look super snazzy at the beach.\n\n1960s\n\nIt\u2019s not a list about UC Berkeley without a mention of the Free Speech Movement. In 1964, students protested a ban on campus activities, which led to protests over the Vietnam War, the \u201cFree Huey\u201d movement and protests in People\u2019s Park throughout the decade. This momentum continues into present day, making UC Berkeley one of the most politically notorious schools ever.\n\n1970s\n\nWhile the 1970s may not be as well known as UC Berkeley\u2019s 1960s, the decade was still a time of big changes and political upheaval. As a result of Third World Liberation Front protests, which fought for a college where the curriculum was designed for and taught by people of color, the ethnic studies department was founded in 1969. In 1974, the African American studies department was approved. These two departments did not fulfill the liberation front\u2019s goal of creating a Third World College.\n\n1980s\n\nIn 1985, students at UC Berkeley fought to divest from South Africa in an anti-apartheid movement. Thousands of students sat in front of the entrance to Sproul Hall and protested UC Berkeley\u2019s investments in companies involved in South Africa at the time. Violence broke out and many students were arrested, but in the end, the students were successful in getting the school to divest from South Africa.\n\n1990s\n\nAstronomers at UC Berkeley aided in the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe in 1998, shocking many. In 2011, three men \u2014UC Berkeley professor Saul Perlmutter, along with Adam Riess and Brian Schmidt \u2014 received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.\n\n2000s\n\nGetting into more recent times, UC Berkeley continued to grow its campus by building both Stanley Hall (2007) and the C.V. Starr East Asian Library (2008).\n\n2010s\n\nWe\u2019ve made it to the present! The 2010s have included some pretty crazy times that a lot of us can remember, such as the Milo Yiannopoulos protest and the fact we\u2019ve lost the Big Game to Stanford every year since 2010. But one of the biggest inventions that may not be on everyone\u2019s radar is the invention of CRISPR technology. CRISPR allows for gene editing and is one of the biggest recent scientific discoveries. The power of gene editing is still being developed, and it\u2019s exciting to see what the future holds for this field.\n\nThere are many more amazing decades of UC Berkeley to come, and we know that the students and professors will continue to do amazing things! This school has contributed to some significant societal advancements, and the students have started movements that have changed the course of history. Here\u2019s to the coming 15 decades of making change!\n\nContact Sunny Sichi at [email protected].", "title": "Key UC Berkeley highlights throughout the decades"}, {"url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2018/02/25/emergency-managers-are-well-prepped-if-a-fukushima-like-nuclear-incident-happens-in-the-u-s/", "content": "In late January and in the wee hours, Californians received a tsunami watch, triggered by a 7.9 earthquake in the Gulf of Alaska. That type of warning is underscored all along the Pacific coastline and especially in Southern California, given that it is the location of a now decommissioned nuclear plant \u2014 but one that still houses spent radioactive fuel.\n\nTo remind, Tokyo Electric Power Co.\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crumbled on March 11, 2011. The earthquake didn\u2019t do it. But the resulting tsunami sure did. In that case, the powerful waves knocked out the backup power that cools the radioactive fuel rods. And without such power, the reactor\u2019s core suffers a meltdown and deadly radiation can escape.\n\nAs for Southern California generally, the structure is in place to deal not just with an incident at Edison International\u2019s San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, or SONGS, but also with respect to all types of emergencies: wildfires, flash floods and earthquakes, to name a few. In all instances, the goal is to keep the calm, restore service and not place the lives of workers at risk while doing so.\n\nThe organizational structure collapses to facilitate decision making. Power is then shifted to a centralized disaster-response team whom is given the authority to carry out the mission. As such, \u201cwar rooms\u201d form and meetings begin with key personnel. Together, the group decides whether resources will be deployed and if so, where and to what extent. Then it becomes a process of continually communicating the logistical strategy.\n\n\u201cWe organize in much the same way: Someone is focused on planning, logistics, finance and mapping \u2014 and those units are all activated,\u201d Holly Crawford, director of the Office of Emergency Services for San Diego County told this writer. \u201cThere is an incident command system that creates an organization to promote efficiencies and chains of command.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, it is the job of the office of emergency services to be prepared in the event of a worst-case scenario \u2014 to do \u201cconsequence management.\u201d That office does not have oversight of the nuclear plant. Rather, it is part of a broader team that comes together during crisis training and that has regular meetings, and even simulates disasters to ensure everyone knows their role.\n\nIn the Heat of Battle\n\nThe real lessons are learned in the heat of battle. Those charged with securing the safety of the broader public set aside their daily routines and instead, go into emergency mode.\n\nWith regard to SONGS, the emergency contingencies have changed because the plant is no longer running. Now, of course, the spent fuel is getting transferred from \u201cwet storage\u201d where the rods that house it are getting cooled in pools to \u201cdry storage\u201d where they will be put in concrete-encased steel cask and buried underground. What it means is that the Federal Emergency Management Agency no longer evaluates the emergency drills at the plant.\n\nTo prepare, San Diego County works with offsite partners that include Southern California Edison that owns SONGS, Orange County and the marine corps base at Camp Pendleton, says Tom Amabile, senior emergency services coordinator for San Diego County, in an interview. The SONGS facility itself has an annual test of its policies and procedures. San Diego County takes part.\n\n\u201cWe have in place all the response mechanisms for when the plant was operational,\u201d Amabile says. \u201cWe always verify \u2014 independently \u2014 what the plant is telling us. We need to do that before we can make a decision. If there was an incident because of movement of the spent fuel, we would respond accordingly by sending out teams, monitoring the area for radiation and offering assistance. We take whatever actions are necessary.\u201d\n\nThe last real-life drill occurred in May 2014 during the Lilac wildfires. While several fires burned simultaneously, extensive planning and training served to mitigate an already bad situation \u2014 one that forced more than 121,000 people to evacuate their homes. And after that emergency, the county adjusted its processes and made improvements to such things as regional collaboration, which includes personnel from 45 different local, state and federal agencies.\n\nNuclear Plants Move Forward\n\nAs for the nuclear energy industry, it is primarily regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC. After the 2011 Fukushima disaster, it evaluated the seismic hazard for all such plants including SONGS. One of its main findings had been to require auxiliary water that would not just keep the fuel rods cooled down but that would also be used to keep the generators running to prevent a massive power outage. Generally, all plants also undergo continual preventive and corrective maintenance, including equipment replacement.\n\nBecause SONGS has been decommissioned, the aim is to now ensure the safe storage of spent fuel inside of the dry cask storage. To that end, activists have expressed concern that the walls of the containers are too thin and that the canisters themselves only have a 40-year lifespan. They would like to see thicker canisters that have 1,000-year lives.\n\n\u201cDry storage has had no release of radiation that has endangered the public or the environment,\u201d says Crawford, with emergency services in San Diego County. \u201cIt is the responsibility of the NRC to license which dry cask storage will be approved.

The run-up is amplified there.\"\n\n\"New Zealand hazard planners have their work cut out,\" he said.\n\nVarious studies have been conducted on the Hikurangi subduction zone, and more are under way, as scientists seek to understand more about what many believe has potential to be the country's single biggest geological hazard.\n\nMegathrust earthquakes in subduction zones have been behind some of the world's biggest disasters.\n\nMost recently, they've included the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami off Japan, which killed nearly 16,000 people, and the 2004 Boxing Day 9.1 quake and tsunami, which killed as many as 280,000.\n\nA Civil Defence and Emergency Management spokesman said such a scenario would be a local source tsunami, for which the \"long or strong\" messages have been especially designed.\n\nCivil Defence advice tsunami safety advice\n\nIf you are near the coast and feel an earthquake that is long and strong, get gone.\n\nIf you are at the coast and experience a strong earthquake that makes it hard to stand up, or a weak rolling earthquake that lasts a minute or more, see a sudden rise or fall in sea level, hear loud and unusual noises from the sea, move immediately to the nearest high ground, or as far inland as you can, walk or bike if possible.\n\nDo not wait for official warnings. For a local source tsunami which could arrive in minutes, there won't be time for an official warning.

Theyare the planet\u2019s most powerful quake. Megthrusts have been the cause of major disasters including the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami that killed 230,000 people around the Indian Ocean, and the 2011 Tohuku tsunami in Japan that left nearly 16,000 people dead.\n\nAnd while New Zealand would be inundated by such an event, Australia would fare far better according to an earthquake expert.\n\nA wave up to 12m high could hit New Zealand in the event of a 'megathrust' (Photo: Ingomar200/Youtube)\n\n\u201cNew Zealand, the northern island is very close to the boundary of the Pacific plate and the Australian plate, so it\u2019s very likely to have earthquakes there,\u201d explained University of Technology\u2019s Associate professor in geotechnical-earthquake engineering Behzad Fatahi.\n\n\u201cA tsunami would be seen in a matter of minutes \u2013 10 to 20 minutes or so,\u201d he told nine.com.au.\n\n\u201cThe size of the tsunami would depend on how much movement the base of the ocean would get. It\u2019s difficult to say what would be the high tsunami.\n\n\u201cIf we expect something around the magnitude of eight we would expect the tsunami to be around five to six metres.\n\n\u201cBut if it was around magnitude of nine, I think we\u2019d get a tsunami of around nine metres.\u201d\n\nAnd while a wall of water that size would devastate New Zealand, Mr Fatahi believes it would likely not damage Australian shores.\n\nMurray, left, and Kelly James look at their destroyed house in central Christchurch, New Zealand, a day after a deadly earthquake (AP Photo/Mark Baker, File)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think because of the megathrust that we have in the middle of the Pacific we will get large tsunamis on the east coast of Australia,\u201d he told nine.com.au.\n\n\u201cWhat happens in New Zealand will be mainly absorbed by the NZ islands, not much would hit Australia.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if we go further up, the east coast of Australia is around 3,000km from the boundary of the Australian and Pacific plates. If we assume a tsunami is travelling with the speed of 800km/h - as it reaches closer to the coast the velocity would drop.\n\n\u201cIt takes around four hours for the tsunami from the middle of the Pacific to reach the east coast of Australia and during this time, this wave will dissipate.\u201d\n\nMr Fatahi says Australia\u2019s most concerning geological threats will come from much closer to home.\n\nCars lie crushed under a fallen building in central Christchurch, New Zealand, following a magnitude 6.3 earthquake (AP Photo/Mark Baker, Pool, File)\n\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s biggest geological hazard would be landslides triggered by floods.

To celebrate the event the French gifted two sculptures. They were paid for with stolen money. The French government is now trying to distance itself from the role it played, Denise McNabb* reports.\n\nIt\u2019s a sunny Saturday on October 1, 2011 and New Zealand Rugby Union officials, the French ambassador, French rugby supporters and the deputy mayor are gathered in downtown Wellington to unveil a large metal and white bronze rugby sculpture, a gift from France.\n\nThe presentation to the New Zealand Rugby Union (since rebranded NZ Rugby) is to mark the 2011 Rugby World Cup and to celebrate a long-standing friendship between France and New Zealand, intense rivalry on the rugby field notwithstanding.\n\nThe seventh Rugby World Cup is in full throttle with France about to play Tonga later in the day. The French would suffer a shock 14-19 defeat, but for now its supporters, their faces painted red, white, and blue are all smiles at the sculpture inauguration.\n\nNZ Rugby (NZR) chief executive, Steve Tew makes an introductory speech. Deputy mayor, Ian McKinnon and French ambassador Francis Etienne pull the cover from the sculpture \u201cLes contre-valuers du rugby\u201d (the opposites of rugby values).\n\nIts sculptor, Nice-based St\u0117phane Cipre, also in attendance alongside his friend and the event\u2019s organiser, former French XV a-side rugby captain Jean Fran\u00e7ois (Jeff) Tordo, proudly holds up a tee shirt sporting All Blacks signatures. A Maori speech, a blessing of the sculpture, a waiata and a photo session wrap up the event.\n\nThe 3.6 metre high sculpture, weighing two tonnes, depicts two rugby players in a scrum against a wall of large words illustrating everything rugby is opposed to - disrespect, lack of discipline, selfishness, drugs, racism, cheating and individualism.\n\nAfter the event it is installed on the corner of Hinemoa Street and Waterloo Quay, a stone\u2019s throw from the former NZ Rugby headquarters in central Wellington.\n\nSearch failure\n\nFast-forward to March 2017 and German engineer and IT coder, Tilman Reissfelder, 43, is in New Zealand with his family on holiday. In 2008 he had become a man of substantial wealth after receiving his share from the sale of the Virtual Tourist website he and J.R. Johnson co-founded to Expedia for $US85 million.\n\nReissfelder has put Wellington on the holiday itinerary for a special reason -to have his photo taken in front of the French rugby sculpture.\n\nHe\u2019s not a rugby fan but \u20ac120,579 ($NZ203,921) had been illegally siphoned from his Boavista International Ltd bank account through a Swiss asset management firm, Hottinger & Partners S.A. to pay Cipre for the sculpture twice \u2013first in 2010 to Cipre\u2019s French bank account then in May 2011 to his Swiss and French bank accounts.\n\nReissfelder left Los Angeles after the Virtual Tourist sale and deposited $US10 million ($NZ13.83m) with Hottinger for investment on the advice of a Californian lawyer who knew one of its managing partners, Fabien Gaglio. Gaglio would later be revealed as a French fraudster who stole it all in a $US100m Ponzi scheme using clients\u2019 money.\n\nThe sculpture was visible on a Google map at the end of Hinemoa Street but when Reissfelder visited the location it wasn\u2019t there. He headed over to NZR\u2019s new headquarters in Molesworth Street but the only sculpture outside that building was a bronzed effigy of former Prime Minister, Sir Keith Holyoake. Construction workers pointed him towards Westpac Stadium but it wasn\u2019t there either so he left town, none the wiser as to its whereabouts.\n\nThe reason it had gone was because NZR had put it into storage in June 2016 due to the risk of earthquake damage; the same reason NZR had moved its offices from Hinemoa Street in 2012.\n\nSo, thanks to the advice of a US lawyer Reissfelder found he unwittingly owned a sculpture he paid for twice over that was nowhere to be seen.\n\nFraud alert\n\nNZR\u2019s executives have known since March last year that the sculpture was swept up in fraud. That's when Dr Ingo Malcher, a journalist at German business magazine and its online publication, Brand Eins International, wrote to NZR alerting it to the fact it could be dragged into Switzerland\u2019s biggest financial fraud. He got no response. Malcher had been poring through thousands of documents gathered by Swiss forensics investigator Dr Andrea Galli as evidence to present in Reissfelder\u2019s case against Gaglio for embezzling his money. The illicit sculpture payment was in the dossier.\n\nMalcher tried ringing NZR but again, got nowhere so wrote the article anyway, using an assumed name for Reissfelder at that point. Reissfelder now speaks under his own name but keeps where he lives private for the personal security of his family and himself.\n\nNZR\u2019s senior media advisor, Juli Clausen, who was at the 2011 sculpture presentation, could not explain why Malcher\u2019s inquiries went unanswered.\n\nChief strategy and operations officer, Nigel Cass, NZR\u2019s tournament services general manager during the 2011 Rugby World Cup, has now made a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are happy to cooperate fully with any authorities with an interest in this matter. To date we have not been contacted by any authorities about this,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also confirmed the sculpture was still in storage, and that NZR had no plans to display or move it.\n\nThe reason NZR has not been contacted by authorities yet is that the sculpture payment is but one on a very long list of thefts detailed in actions against 39-year-old Gaglio that are either lumbering through or being processed for hearings in courts in Italy, Switzerland, France and Luxembourg. Swiss authorities are looking at fraud, forgery, misappropriation of funds and money laundering against Gaglio, his business partner at Hottinger, Jean-Francois de Clermont-Tonnerre, and potentially others. These are expected to take years to be heard because of the sheer volume of transactions that need to be examined and it would appear because of the lapse in time the impetus for prosecutions has slowed.\n\nGaglio used his position at Hottinger & Partners S.A. where he was managing partner, as a cover for embezzling clients out of $US100m. It has been reported he focused on nine particularly wealthy clients, Reissfelder included, who he developed personal relationships with.\n\nHe created fictitious accounts for the affluent clients that showed their investments were prospering. In reality he was stealing their money and shuffling their remaining funds between clients when withdrawals were requested.\n\nGaglio\u2019s actions proved to be the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back at Hottinger & Partners\u2019 depositary bank, Hottinger & Cie, a Swiss institution that has been around since the 18th century. It had its own taxation and liquidity issues at the time but the Ponzi scheme accelerated it into bankruptcy and it was wound up.\n\nDubbed a mini-Gallic Madoff by Galli, Bloomberg recently reported how Gaglio brazenly walked into a Paris police station on January 23, 2013 and confessed to taking the money, claiming it had all gone. The court ordered him to pay back \u20ac150,000.\n\nDocuments Galli gathered show that stolen client funds were spent on lavish holidays, including on an entourage of friends and associates for a trip to the 2011 New Zealand Rugby World Cup. Gaglio told Reissfelder he went to New Zealand for the World Cup.\n\nHe bought artwork, leased private jets, lavished gifts and large amounts of money on friends and relatives and used stolen money to schmooze clients, unbeknown to them, from their own funds. Gaglio lived a lifestyle of such excess that he has been likened to F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s Jay Gatsby and the notorious Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nHis January 2013 confession has so far earned him a five-year jail sentence, reduced to four years after he appealed. He served one year in a Luxembourg jail because its authorities were quickest to charge him with the crimes of forgery, fraud and money laundering he did in that country. In Europe it is a central element of penal systems to parole prisoners for up to half the time of the actual sentence. While Gaglio has been on parole he has been living with his wife, Fanny and children in a luxurious home on the French Riviera and working as an olive farmer. He declared to the court his parents were paying for his living expenses. He is supposed to go back to jail soon to serve his remaining year but no date has been set yet.\n\nUlterior motive\n\nReissfelder says paying $US1m to Galli for his vast amount of time and work gathering and interpreting thousands of pages of documents, bank accounts, invoices and memos (now also seen by interest.co.nz) in 88 folders of evidence obtained under discovery has been worth every cent in his pursuit of Gaglio and the funds he stole.\n\nWhen cross-referencing the thousands of documents from the Geneva Prosecutor\u2019s Office and elsewhere Galli quickly deduced that Gaglio\u2019s mea culpa at the Paris police station was more than likely a pre-emptive strike to stymie a probe into a much grander scheme he was operating than the Hottinger Ponzi.\n\nEverything pointed to a money laundering ring funnelling funds in excess of \u20ac250m through a sprawling global network of shell companies, including three registered in New Zealand over a 15 year period that started before Gaglio and de Clermont Tonnere set up Hottinger. Gaglio had worked prior to Hottinger at private wealth firms such as Rothschild so had a healthy file of rich contacts.\n\nCompanies created by shady shell company incorporators are peppered through the documents, including some from the infamous GT Group, headed by Geoffrey Taylor whose Auckland-based SP Trading Ltd orchestrated what transpired to be a botched North Korean arms smuggling mission to Iran in breach of United Nations sanctions in 2009.\n\nCircled in this document (below), for instance, is a 100,000 Swiss franc ($NZ146,428) transaction in Gaglio\u2019s accounts laundered via Ostek Group Ltd (struck off by the New Zealand Companies Office in July, 2011) under the guise of a payment for crockery. On the same day 99,970 Swiss Francs (CHF) of that total landed in Gaglio\u2019s Belize-registered Glendale Portfolio Inc., a repository for many millions funnelled out of Gaglio\u2019s clients\u2019 accounts and transaction fees.\n\nCompanies registered in New Zealand by Latvian stooge director, Erik Vanagels, also feature. The accounts also show other New Zealand connections, including a starring role by Asiaciti Trust New Zealand Ltd, another shell creator with a history of dubious transactions and players as noted in an investigation of Asiaciti published last month by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.\n\nAnother reason it appears Gaglio chose to give himself up in France even though most of his criminal activities were outside the country was because France doesn\u2019t allow its citizens to be extradited to other countries unless they agree to the extradition.\n\nAnother \u201cgift\u201d\n\nThe Wellington rugby sculpture wasn\u2019t the only one connected to Gaglio that was shipped to New Zealand during the 2011 Rugby World Cup. On October 20, 2011 France\u2019s then Minister for Sports, David Douillet \u201cofficially presented\u201d a two metre-high black resin sculpture L\u2019enjeu (At Stake) to the Crusaders team at its Rugby Park headquarters as a way of empathising with the people of Christchurch after the city\u2019s devastating earthquake.\n\nThe same group as the Wellington event were on hand and the sculpture, created by Laurence Bonnel (pictured above standing beside it), is today still on display at the end of the park.\n\nThe Crusaders chief executive, Hamish Riach was part of that presentation and said he has never considered the sculpture as anything but a gift from the French government. He said the fact that the French sports minister presented the sculpture endorsed that view.\n\nA press release distributed at the time, and still on the French Embassy website, mentioned Douillet was there on behalf of an association, Les Amoureux du Rugby (Rugby Lovers) but no explanation appears to have been given about what or who this group was.\n\nDouillet told those assembled that day that he was honoured to show France's ongoing support to Canterbury.\n\n\"Relations between France and New Zealand have gone far beyond rugby,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Christchurch honorary French consul, Martine Marshall Durieux was also there and Riach met Bonnel, who was among the guests.\n\n\u201cChristchurch didn\u2019t have a World Cup event in 2011 because of the earthquake damage,\u201d Riach said.\n\n\u201cThe city was going through a tumultuous time and we gratefully received this sculpture, both because it was linked to the World Cup and because it marked the generosity of another country.\n\n\u201cThis news about its funding is a complete surprise to me.\n\n\u201cLike NZR, we also haven\u2019t been contacted by authorities but we will fully co-operate if contacted.\u201d\n\nGovernment shrugs\n\nHow French government representatives came to officiate at both presentations in what were essentially privately initiated events is not known.\n\nFor its part, the French Embassy in Wellington is distancing itself.\n\nIn a brief statement it said: \u201cThis embassy was only involved in the unveiling ceremonies, taking advantage of the presence of the Minister for Sports at the time in New Zealand for the Rugby World Cup.\u201d\n\nFrancis Etienne, the French ambassador who participated in both the Wellington and Christchurch sculpture unveilings, was posted to Kazakhstan in 2013.\n\nSculptor with connections\n\nAccording to Galli\u2019s document dossier, Bonnel received at least one unauthorised payment of \u20ac30,031.50 for the Christchurch sculpture from the bank account of a Californian dermatologist, another of Gaglio\u2019s clients. Court documents show that in 2012 an air ticket was paid for her by a Gaglio account for her to travel with his family and others to Madrid and Costa Rica. The ticket cost 2,520 CHF (Swiss francs). In 2015 Bonnel married French three-star Michelin chef, Yannick All\u0117no, a good friend of Gaglio\u2019s who has been implicated in his thefts and money laundering.\n\nThe Rugby Lovers LLC (also known as Les Amoureux du Rugby) is not an association as was erroneously written at the time of the Christchurch presentation, but it is integral to the sculptures saga. The company was registered in California on May 2, 2010 by Thomas M. Giordano-Lascari, a Los Angeles income tax and transactional attorney who joined law firm Karlin & Peebles in 2014 as a specialist in international matters for high net worth individuals.\n\nThat firm\u2019s principal, Michael Karlin also features in the documents linked to Reissfelder\u2019s stolen funds. Payments from his Boavista account totalling \u20ac120,000 were made to Invertigo Dance Theatre, a Los Angeles dance theatre company founded by Karlin\u2019s daughter Laura Karlin. Michael Karlin is also a lawyer for the LA dermatologist whose money was used to fund the Christchurch sculpture.\n\nPhoto: Scoop Rugby Lovers LLC was owned by Gaglio and overseen by his friend, the former rugby captain, Jeff Tordo who is second from left in this photo in front of the Wellington sculpture after the presentation. NZR chief executive, Steve Tew is next to him at the back; Cipre is in front holding the signed tee shirt and French ambassador, Francis Etienne is second from the right.\n\nInvoices in the Galli files, some with fake or overvalued amounts reveal a trail of lavish spending by Rugby Lovers LLC during the 2011 Rugby World Cup. There were business class air tickets for Tordo\u2019s wife, and other friends and associates of Gaglio. There was a dinner for 45 people, payment to Nadau, a folk group from the B\u0117arn region of southwest France for its performance in New Zealand during the event, and non-itemised supplementary costs. In all, the event, excluding the payment for the sculptures, gouged \u20ac1.5m from Hottinger & Partners S.A. clients\u2019 accounts, including Reissfelder\u2019s.\n\nTordo has not responded to questions sent by interest.co.nz asking about his role in the Gaglio imbroglio. Both he and his wife, Pascale were close friends of Gaglio and his wife, Fanny. Documents show Tordo was tied up with Cap SUD, a Gaglio-linked company that installs and manages photovoltaic power plants.\n\nTordo ran a humanitarian and environmental foundation, Association Pachamama in Madagascar with another Gaglio associate, St\u00e9phane Gilli. The Michelin-starred cook All\u0117no (Bonnel\u2019s husband) was also involved in this foundation and it had several bank transactions with Hottinger. Pachamama was placed in judicial liquidation in January last year.\n\nAnother key player in the rugby saga is Groupe Eventeam SAS, a French agency that specialises in corporate hospitality, events and ticketing for major sporting events. It organised Gaglio\u2019s French entourage\u2019s trip to New Zealand for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, commissioned under the auspices of Rugby Lovers LLC.\n\nGaglio owned a 33 per cent stake in its 100 per cent affiliate Eventeam SAS until 2014 via two companies, Luxembourg-registered Sigma Private Equity SA and Cyprus-registered Sigma Venture Capital Ltd. Before both Sigma companies were dissolved by voluntary liquidation in 2016 records show Gaglio used them to siphon millions of Euros from several clients, Reissfelder included.\n\nBetween October 2010 and February 2011 an illicit transaction from Reissfelder\u2019s Boavista account for \u20ac660,00 was transferred to Eventeam SAS, including fake invoices from The Rugby Lovers LLC for the New Zealand spend-up, for example.\n\nIan McKinnon, a former Chancellor of Victoria University, who attended the Wellington sculpture unveiling in his capacity as deputy mayor of Wellington, says he remembers the day well. He says it was all a bit of a rush but recalls plenty of French rugby supporters whose smiles that day would have been wiped from their faces when the All Blacks beat France 9-8 in the final to clinch the Rugby World Cup.\n\nAs to the future of the New Zealand rugby sculptures, Reissfelder says he feels bad about the whole thing even though it wasn\u2019t his doing.\n\n\u201cIf they [NZ Rugby] were to return the money I would take part of it and make a donation with the rest but I don\u2019t want them to think this is an expectation,\u201d he said.\n\nStill to come: Part II, How New Zealand played its part in Fabien Gaglio\u2019s global laundromat.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Denise McNabb is a New Zealand freelance journalist.

Despite their contention that recent developments at Community Medical were out of order, state health officials said the agency could not take further action to force the hospital to restore its previous scope of emergency room services.\n\nAt issue is a recent order from the Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services Agency, or LACEMS, requiring paramedics to take patients who need advanced life support services to emergency rooms other than the one at Community Medical. Long Beach officials last week complained that the \u201castounding\u201d decision did not provide the fire department enough time to plan for the change.\n\nCommunity Medical Center Chief Executive John Bishop said officials working for the local EMS agency, as opposed to hospital administrators, made the final decision to send patients receiving advanced paramedic care away from Community Medical. The diversions have now been happening for about a week.\n\n\u201cLACEMS evaluated the circumstances at Community and, in the interest of ensuring optimum patient safety and minimizing disruption to the emergency medical services transport system, LACEMS made the decision to place Community Medical Center Long Beach\u2019s emergency department on extended ALS ambulance transport diversion,\u201d Bishop said in a statement.\n\nPublic Health officials, however, say the EMS agency granted approval to a decision made by hospital leaders.\n\nA representative of the EMS agency could not be reached for comment Friday.\n\nALS services can include cardiac monitoring, the administration of an IV line or defibrillation, among other services, according to the Long Beach Fire Department. Basic life support services include CPR or treating an injury with bandages or a splint.\n\nBefore the order to divert ALS patients to other facilities, Community Medical accepted about six ALS patients per day, compared with about eight BLS patients per day, according to MemorialCare. City data shows Long Beach paramedics carried nearly 5,000 total patients during the 12-month period ending Oct. 31 to the hospital.\n\nNurses assemble support for Community Medical\n\nThe state agency\u2019s confirmation of this citation came on the same day the California Nurses Association hosted a press conference to protest recent decisions to close Community Medical and, more recently, the diversions of certain emergency patients.\n\nThe nurses union has disputed hospital managers\u2019 position that the quicker closure timeline is due to Community Medical employees\u2019 decision to seek other jobs following management\u2019s November\u2019s announcement that the East Long Beach hospital cannot feasibly be retrofitted to meet state seismic standards or to close as an acute care hospital.\n\nMemorialCare Health System, a nonprofit that runs several other Long Beach and Orange County hospitals, has leased Community Medical Center from city government since 2011. Several city officeholders, Mayor Robert Garcia and councilmen Rex Richardson, Daryl Supernaw and Roberto Uranga, allied themselves with nurses union members and other local elected officials during Friday\u2019s media conference.\n\nCommunity Medical has a mid-2019 deadline to meet earthquake safety standards. Other medical services, such as psychiatric care, could still be provided at the Community Medical campus after the deadline. In mid-February, however, Garcia, Supernaw and City Manager Pat West sent a letter to MemorialCare declining the suggestion to convert Community Medical into a psychiatric hospital.\n\nCity officials and others objecting to closure plans have said Community Medical\u2019s emergency room must be preserved. City Hall is seeking another company willing to take a chance on operating Community Medical Center.\n\nBesides elected officials, speakers at Friday\u2019s press conference included Jimmy Eleopoulos, a man who said paramedics took his brother to Community Medical while he was in need of life-saving care after a cardiac emergency on March 5.\n\n\u201cHe was brought here to the hospital where they revived him not once, but twice right in there, by the great people here, and I thank them. I thank them, from the bottom of my heart,\u201d Eleopoulos said.\n\nEleopoulos went on to say that he later learned that Long Beach Medical Center and Dignity Health St. Mary Medical Center could not have accepted his brother on the night of March 5. Thus if Community Medical had not been open, Eleopoulos\u2019 brother may have risked a long ambulance ride.\n\n\u201cIf my brother was to be taken, literally from 10 blocks away to another hospital .. out of the city, he might not have made it, and that\u2019s very, very disturbing,\u201d Eleopoulos said.\n\nGarcia said during Friday\u2019s press conference that it\u2019s been disappointing to witness the demise of the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe understand that there are seismic issues, but we really were hopeful that there would be more of a partnership during this time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not acceptable to the city of Long Beach to have been given little to no notice to go from the expected closure to then, the immediate diversion of emergency services.\u201d", "title": "State warns Community Medical Center Long Beach of possible violation related to emergency room diversions \u2013 Press Telegram"}, {"url": "https://www.sfgate.com/news/bayarea/article/Tuesday-Morning-News-Roundup-12766499.php", "content": "Tuesday Morning News Roundup\n\nThe 1,200-seat Lincoln Theater at the Napa Valley Performing Arts Center was filled to capacity Monday evening to celebrate the lives of three female employees of The Pathway Home veterans' treatment and recovery center who were killed by a former client 10 days ago.\n\nExecutive director Christine Loeber and staff psychologists Jennifer Gonzales Shushereba and Jennifer Gray Golick were lauded for their devoted and selfless dedication to improving the lives of the veterans in their care.\n\n\"They used their inner light to fight darkness,\" Keith Armstrong of the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Healthcare System said. \"We may be shattered but we are not deterred by what has happened.\"\n\nLoeber, 48, Golick, 42, and Gonzales Shushereba, 32, died immediately when they were shot with a rifle by Albert Wong, 36, of Sacramento. Wong then shot himself in the head with a shotgun and died.\n\nRecommended Video: Now Playing:\n\nGonzales Shushereba's unborn child Cecilia Rose also perished from a lack of oxygenated blood after her mother's death, according to the Napa County Sheriff's Office.\n\nWong had been a client at The Pathway Home but reportedly was asked to leave not long before the slayings. He returned with a grudge on March 9.\n\nGonzales Shushereba's father Michael Gonzales said each of the women had their own attributes that made them special.\n\n\"They were doing a job that was thankless and was never going to end,\" Gonzales said. \"Who does that? Only the best person.\"\n\nGolick was remembered as \"a gifted healer and a woman with a big heart,\" according to Armstrong.\n\nShe joined The Pathway Home in September 2017 after working in family service programs in Petaluma. She believed in working as a team and not just for oneself and was about to celebrate her 20th anniversary with her husband, Armstrong said.\n\nLoeber, a former Boston resident and Red Sox fan, left a career in sports marketing and moved west to focus on women's health, according to Armstrong.\n\nShe brought an East Coast determination with her, he said.\n\n\"When a New Englander says, I'm gonna get it done, they get it done,\" Armstrong said. \"She wanted to dig into the soil of human experience.\"\n\nThe three women's families were each presented with an American flag.\n\nYountville Mayor John Dunbar said he was honored to represent members of the community at the ceremony.\n\n\"All our hearts are broken,\" Dunbar said. \"Now it's on us to continue serving our veterans.\"\n\nDunbar said the women's families appreciated the outpouring of support and asked that the community continue to serve the veterans and the mission they gave their lives for.\n\nGonzales said, \"We'll close ranks and hunker down and find a way to grieve. We ask for your privacy.\"\n\nThe Posey Tube, which connects Alameda to Oakland in the eastbound direction underneath the Oakland Inner Harbor, is now open to traffic as repairs to a sinkhole were completed ahead of schedule, Alameda Public Works announced Monday night.\n\nThe tube was closed to traffic after 10 a.m. Monday to repair the sinkhole, which developed on the Oakland end of the tunnel this weekend.\n\nWork was completed on the sinkhole at 9:30 p.m. Monday, according to Oakland police. Initial estimates planned the repair work to last through the week and possibly longer, but police said accelerated repairs allowed the tube to reopen sooner.\n\nAmtrak officials confirmed that there was a fatality when a Capitol Corridor train hit a pedestrian Monday afternoon in Solano County.\n\nThe collision happened at about 1 p.m. near Tabor Avenue in Fairfield, according to Amtrak officials.\n\nAn Amtrak spokeswoman said the collision did not happen in a railway crossing.\n\nThere were 129 passengers and crewmembers on the train when it struck the pedestrian, but there were no reported injuries aboard the train.\n\nAmtrak police is working with local law enforcement to conduct an investigation into the fatality.\n\nA preliminary hearing for two former Alameda County sheriff's deputies accused of beating a man in 2015 in a San Francisco alley following a vehicle chase across the Bay Bridge began Monday in San Francisco where a judge will ultimately determine whether the two should stand trial.\n\nLuis Santamaria, a 14-year veteran of the department, and Paul Wieber, a three-year veteran, have both been charged with assault under the color of authority, battery with serious bodily injury and assault with a deadly weapon in connection with the alleged Nov. 12, 2015 beating.\n\nAt Monday's hearing, prosecutors sought to include the batons used by the former deputies on Stanislav Petrov as evidence.\n\nThe hearing also included testimony from San Francisco police Sgt. Thomas MacMahon, who was initially tasked with investigating some aspects of the alleged beating.\n\nMacMahon said that soon after he began his investigation, he hired a University of California at Berkeley Police Department lieutenant who is an expert in use-of-force policy. MacMahon said the expert, Lt. Joey Williams, initially watched video of the beating and indicated in a report that the use of force used by the deputies on Petrov was not unreasonable.\n\nSantamaria's defense attorney, Michael Rains, however said that Williams later amended his report after the district attorney's office took over the investigation. In the amended version, Williams determined that the use of force was not reasonable.\n\n\"The investigation by the DA's office has been driven by politics from the very inception of this case,\" Rains said outside of court. \"His (Williams') first conclusion is clear, that the force is reasonable, and then all of a sudden, after the report is sent to the DA's office, he's having second thoughts?\"\n\nRains said if the case goes to trial, he plans to use experts on video analysis to explain how use of force is viewed and determined.\n\nThe deputies were allegedly seen on camera beating Petrov after an early morning high-speed chase that began in unincorporated San Leandro, where Petrov had allegedly used a stolen car to ram two marked sheriff's patrol cars, causing minor injuries to one deputy, before fleeing in a stolen car.\n\nThe pursuit ended at Stevenson and 14th streets in San Francisco's Mission District, where Petrov ran out of gas and crashed the car. The alleged beating occurred a short distance away on Clinton Park.\n\nProsecutors allege Santamaria and Wieber struck Petrov at least 30 times over the course of 40 seconds in the head and hands with their batons. Petrov suffered injuries including a concussion, broken bones in both hands, a mild traumatic brain injury and deep cuts to his head.\n\nThe case against Santamaria and Wieber came to light after the San Francisco Public Defender's Office obtained video surveillance footage of the alleged beating.\n\nIn April of last year, Alameda County agreed to pay $5.5 million to settle a federal civil rights lawsuit filed by Petrov. Petrov's suit had alleged that while he lay in the alley with multiple fractures on both hands, suffering from a concussion and bleeding from multiple head lacerations, deputies stood around and exchanged \"high fives\" and took trophy photos of him.\n\nThe suit also alleged that a deputy at the scene, identified as former Deputy Shawn Osborne, stole a gold chain and cash from Petrov after he was beaten and gave the chain to witnesses in order to buy their silence.\n\nAlthough the sheriff's office recommended that Petrov be charged with 12 offenses for allegedly stealing the car and ramming the patrol cars, the Alameda County District Attorney's Office declined to charge him with any offense.\n\nHowever, Petrov remains in custody, facing gun and drug charges in a federal case following a March 8, 2016, search of his apartment by the FBI.\n\nSince the alleged beating, sheriff's officials have increased training around use of force, examined the department's hiring practices and revised its body camera procedures to make it mandatory that deputies always turn them on when they're interacting with the public.\n\nSantamaria and Wieber are free on bail. The preliminary hearing is scheduled to continue Wednesday.\n\nRetail giant Costco Wholesale Corporation and a Northern California coffee company have agreed to pay $500,000 in civil penalties to settle a consumer protection action for the sale of plastic coffee pods, Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley said Monday.\n\nThe settlement was based on allegations that Costco, which is based in Issaquah, Wash., and JBR of Roseville, which does business as San Francisco Bay Gourmet Coffee and Rogers Family Company, sold plastic coffee pods that are labeled with untrue and misleading marketing claims, including statements related to biodegradability and compostability, O'Malley said.\n\n\"California consumers trying to help reduce the problem of plastic waste in landfills are often misled to believe that plastic products labeled as 'biodegradable' will break down in municipal trash,\" O'Malley said in a statement.\n\nBut O'Malley said most landfills prevent biodegradation and \"in order to prevent misleading consumers, the state Legislature banned the sale of plastic products labeled with language implying they will biodegrade.\"\n\nO'Malley said consumers interested in diverting plastic waste from landfills to municipal composting facilities should look for products that are labeled as having met scientific compostability standards, specifically a compostable plastics certification called \"ASTM D6400.\"\n\nPlastic coffee pods sold by San Francisco Bay Gourmet Coffee and the plastic bags they came in were labeled \"97% biodegradable\" and \"biodegradable,\" despite a legal ban on such products' sale, as well as compostable, despite a legal ban on the sale of such products unless certain standards are met, according to O'Malley.\n\nThe company also labeled its \"Onecup\" coffee pods as \"No Plastic Cup,\" when the ring, mesh, and part of the lid were all made of plant-based plastic, O'Malley said.\n\nAlameda County Superior Court Judge Morris Jacobson issued a stipulated final judgment settling the matter.\n\nO'Malley said 24 other district attorneys in California joined her office in bringing the action.\n\nCostco didn't respond to a request for comment on the settlement.\n\nO'Malley said plastic waste can take up to a thousand years to decompose, depending on the environment in which it is disposed.\n\nShe said landfills, in particular, tend to mummify trash rather than biodegrade it, since decomposition requires sunlight, moisture, and oxygen.\n\nThe judgment prohibits Costco and JBR from selling the plastic coffee pods if they're labeled \"biodegradable.\"\n\nThe companies are also prohibited from selling them if they're labeled \"compostable\" unless a scientific certification supports the claim.\n\nAn aging seawall along San Francisco's iconic waterfront would leave the city defenseless in the event of sea level rise or a major earthquake, but new state legislation announced Monday would help secure more funding to strengthen it.\n\nAssembly Bill 2578, introduced by Assemblyman David Chiu, would provide the state with a mechanism to contribute to the Seawall Earthquake Safety Program and would generate an estimated $55 million in the first ten years of the program and a total of $250 million over the life of the program.\n\nChiu announced the bill Monday at Pier 14, alongside Mayor Mark Farrell, Supervisors London Breed and Jane Kim, state Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, and executive director of the Port of San Francisco Elaine Forbes.\n\nThe Embarcadero Seawall, first constructed in 1879, covers more than three miles of the city's northern waterfront and protects the city from flooding and supports infrastructure like BART, the San Francisco Municipal Railway and ferry service.\n\n\"We know with near certainty that the big one will strike us within the next three decades. And if it does, we'll see catastrophic flooding along our waterfront,\" Chiu said. \"It's imperative that we protect this asset not just for San Francisco but for the Bay and for our California economy.\"\n\nAB 2578 would allow the city to direct taxes designated for schools to the Port's infrastructure financing district and authorize the use of that funding for shoreline improvement, according to Chiu's office.\n\nUp to $5 billion is needed to make the infrastructure improvements.\n\nA proposed $350 to 500 million general obligation bond for the program, which is being considered for the November ballot, would help raise funds to fill in budget gaps, Chiu's office said.\n\n\"This is really about two realties of life: sea level rise and earthquakes,\" Wiener said. \"And much as we want to wish them all away, the big earthquake is going to come and unless we take radical action today around reducing carbon emission and fighting climate change, we are going to continue to see sea level rise.\"\n\n\"Let's be clear, this is about planning for the future of our city,\" Mayor Mark Farrell said. \"It is about infrastructure. It is about making sure that our city is resilient when the next earthquake hits.\"\n\nA suspect appeared in court Monday on a murder charge for allegedly fatally shooting a Berkeley man during a fight in West Oakland in December.\n\nMelvin Andrew Allen Jr., 35, was scheduled to enter a plea Monday to the charge that he fatally shot 30-year-old Dominique Johnson in the vicinity of West Grand Avenue and Brush Street at about 10:30 p.m. on Dec. 23.\n\nBut Allen postponed entering his plea Monday for the third straight court day and is scheduled to return to court a fourth time today to possibly enter a plea at that time if he's prepared to do so.\n\nAllen and Johnson got into a fight at 23rd and Brush streets at about 10:25 p.m. on Dec. 23, Oakland police Sgt. Bradley Baker wrote in a probable cause statement.\n\nThe two men then got into a second confrontation about a block away at West Grand Avenue and Brush Street a short time later and \"Allen produced a handgun and shot Johnson in the chest,\" Baker said.\n\nAllen fled the scene and Johnson died at a hospital a short time later, according to Baker.\n\nAllen was identified as the person who shot Johnson through video surveillance camera footage, witness statements and physical evidence, Baker wrote.\n\nAllen was arrested by patrol officers in the 600 block of 23rd Street at about 1 p.m. on March 5 after a short foot pursuit, Baker said.\n\nWhen Allen was interviewed by investigators he denied being involved in Johnson's shooting death, according to Baker.\n\nAllen is an ex-felon who is prohibited from possessing a firearm because he was convicted of possession for sale of cocaine and cocaine base in Alameda County in September 2015, Baker wrote.\n\nHowever, the Alameda County District Attorney's Office didn't charge Allen with being an ex-felon in possession of a firearm.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments today on the constitutionality of a California law that requires pregnancy crisis clinics to inform patients about the availability of abortions.\n\nA coalition of clinics that oppose abortion on religious grounds claims the 2015 law violates the centers' First Amendment rights of free speech and freedom of religion by forcing them to give a message they \"profoundly\" oppose.\n\n\"Forcing a pro-life group to advertise for abortion has to be unconstitutional,\" lawyers for the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, or NIFLA, argued in a brief filed in January.\n\nThe group is appealing a decision in which the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld the law in 2016.\n\nThe appeals court said the law is a neutral measure that does not discriminate on the basis of religious beliefs, and that it supports the state's interests in \"safeguarding public health and fully informing Californians of the existence of publicly funded medical services.\"\n\nPregnancy crisis clinics are centers that provide pregnancy-related services but do not offer abortions or emergency contraception or referrals for such services.\n\nNIFLA has told the high court the centers have \"the sole mission of encouraging expectant mothers to give their children the opportunity for life.\"\n\nThe state law is called the Reproductive FACT (Freedom, Accountability, Comprehensive Care and Transparency) Act and its stated purpose is to assure that \"all California women, regardless of income...have access to reproductive health services.\"\n\nIt requires state-licensed medical clinics providing pregnancy-related services to post notices telling patients that California has free and low-cost programs that offer comprehensive family planning services, including contraception, prenatal care and abortion.\n\nThe notices must give the telephone number of the county social services office so that patients can obtain more information. Unlicensed clinics are required to inform patients that they lack state licenses to provide medical care.\n\nThe Supreme Court's eventual ruling, due by the end of June, could affect two related local laws enacted by the cities of San Francisco and Oakland.\n\nThe two local laws take a slightly different approach from the state law: while the FACT Act requires certain disclosures, the San Francisco and Oakland laws ban misleading and false advertising about the services offered by pregnancy crisis centers.\n\nThe San Francisco law, enacted in 2011, was aimed at centers that allegedly advertise they can help women with unintended pregnancies decide what to do next, but don't disclose they are anti-abortion and don't provide referrals for the procedure.\n\nThe San Francisco law was upheld last year by the 9th Circuit in a separate lawsuit filed by the First Resort center, also known as Support Circle, in San Francisco.\n\nThe center appealed last month to the Supreme Court for review of that ruling. The case is still in an early stage of briefing on whether the high court should take up the case, and San Francisco's response is not due until April 19.\n\nMeanwhile, however, San Francisco and Oakland, together with Santa Clara County, Los Angeles, New York and Baltimore, joined in a friend-of-the court brief supporting the state law being argued today.\n\nThe brief alleges that while some centers advertise their services honestly, others deceptively suggest they provide abortions, give women inaccurate medical and legal information and delay women in obtaining care until it is too late for a legal abortion.\n\n\"The FACT Act disclosures advance California's compelling interests in combating consumer deception, protecting public health, and promoting informed decision-making,\" the cities' brief argues.\n\nIn the San Francisco case, lawyers for First Resort suggested in their Supreme Court petition in February that the center's lawsuit is so closely related to the FACT Act case that high court might want to put the local case on hold until it decides the state-law case.\n\nThe trial of a former Sonoma County sheriff's deputy charged with assault by a public officer of a 37-year-old Sonoma Valley man in his home in 2016 ended Monday morning with a hung jury.\n\nThe Sonoma County Superior Court jury was deadlocked 8-4 in favor of acquitting 41-year-old Scott Thorne. The jury deliberated briefly Thursday and resumed deliberations around 9:30 a.m. Monday before reporting it was deadlocked around 11 a.m.\n\nThorne was charged with assaulting Fernando Del Valle with a baton and shooting him twice with a Taser stun gun when Del Valle refused to get out of bed in the bedroom of his home in Boyes Hot Springs.\n\nA neighbor called the sheriff's office around 10:30 p.m. on Sept. 24, 2016, when she heard Del Valle and his wife arguing. Three deputies responded and the assault was recorded by a deputy's body camera.\n\nThe sheriff's office announced in October 2016 that the body camera video showed Thorne used excessive force for the circumstances, that he violated the office's use of force policy and said he was no longer employed by the sheriff's office.\n\nIn his opening statement to the jury, Deputy District Attorney Robert Waner said Del Valle was beaten and subjected to a humiliating arrest in front of his neighbors. He said Thorne lacked \"the soft skills of patience and restraint\" and he used force without lawful necessity.\n\nThorne's attorney Chris Andrian said by not complying with Thorne's demands to open the door and get out of bed, Del Valle forfeited his right to privacy. He said Del Valle was actively resisting arrest and Thorne was responding to the circumstances as he was trained.\n\nAfter the mistrial, Andrian said the split verdict reflects the mood of the country on police use of force.\n\n\"People have different views. Their feelings are not the same,\" Andrian said.\n\nThe jury's foreperson, who did not want to be identified, said deliberations were \"quite heated and emotional\" from the beginning.\n\n\"Everyone agreed there was bad policing, the situation was not handled well and Fernando (Del Valle) was a challenging individual,\" the juror said.\n\n\"We all couldn't agree whether the assault was justified,\" she said.\n\nAfter the verdict, the case was transferred to a different department, and a hearing is scheduled next Monday on whether the prosecution will retry the case.\n\nWaner did not comment on the mistrial Monday morning.\n\n###", "title": "Tuesday Morning News Roundup"}, {"url": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/science/102022004/kiwis-need-to-be-aware-of-the-risks-of-living-in-a-dynamic-environment", "content": "Kiwis need to be aware of the risks of living in a dynamic environment\n\ningomar200 Up to 12m-high waves crash into the North Island's east coast.

That may seem like a reassuringly long time, except that the most recent two happened in only the last 600 years.\n\nOne of them is well documented \u2013 the magnitude 8.2 Wairarapa earthquake of 1855 which dashed buildings to the ground in the young settlement of Wellington, raised land out of the sea along the its waterfront, and sent tidal waves over Miramar Peninsula. At Palliser Bay, the tsunami was 9 metres high and washed away buildings and boats.\n\nTREVOR BURKHART The seabed at Ward, north of Kaikoura, was thrust upward by 1.8 metres in the November 2016 earthquake.\n\nThere is evidence of a much earlier massive earthquake or series of events which possibly gave rise to the legend of Hao-Whenua, or \"the land swallower\".\n\nThe story of Hao-Whenua was told to the early 20th century Pakeha ethnologist Elsdon Best by Wairarapa Maori who informed him there were formerly two entrances to Wellington Harbour \u2013 the current entrance and one where the suburb of Kilbirnie now stands.\n\nBest was sceptical of the story because he could not fathom how an earthquake which lifted the seabed could be called a \"land swallower\". He apparently did not consider that the name might refer not to the quake, but to the subsequent tidal waves which swept in from the sea.\n\nBest reckoned Hao-Whenua came 18 generations before his time, which would coincide with archaeological and other evidence which suggests that many coastal dwellers moved inland in the middle of the 15th century.\n\nIn modern times, while there is no immediate reason to be alarmed, no-one should turn a blind eye to the deadly potential of an offshore quake which, at possibly magnitude 9, could be much stronger than the Kaikoura earthquake of 2016.\n\nAnd no-one should blame scientists, or accuse them of being alarmist, when they simply tell what they can see in the evidence before them.

Photos by Thinkstock and YouTube.\n\nAlmost since its founding, Twitter has regarded itself as a platform for news; watershed moments in the company\u2019s history included the Arab Spring and a 2011 East Coast earthquake. Facebook began talking as early as 2013 about wanting to be a sort of \u201cpersonalized newspaper,\u201d only to realize more recently that separating real news from propaganda was harder than it had anticipated. Both companies have spent much of the past year reckoning with their roles in spreading hoaxes, facilitating election interference, and fueling societal division and extremism.\n\nGoogle\u2019s YouTube, in contrast, has until recently managed to skirt the brunt of the criticism that rival social media platforms have faced. As a result, it has been relatively slow to grapple with the implications of its role as a source of news\u2014and, inevitably, of misinformation. As recently as October, in a series of congressional hearings, Google downplayed the significance of its video platform in Russian election interference, while Facebook and Twitter fielded the toughest questions.\n\nNow a series of controversies is forcing YouTube to address its responsibilities more directly and candidly than it has in the past. At the South by Southwest Interactive conference this week in Austin, Texas, an appearance by YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki made it clear that the platform is finally giving serious thought to the quality and veracity of information its users are getting. It also made clear that the company has a lot of catching up to do.\n\nIn January, star YouTube vlogger Logan Paul sparked a backlash when he published a video showing the dead body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan. Google responded by canceling Paul\u2019s \u201cpreferred\u201d ad deal and suspending his projects for its premium video service, YouTube Red. That came as the company was already dealing with a series of reports revealing disturbing cartoons apparently aimed at kids (it subsequently deleted 150,000 of them) and another genre of videos depicting children in abusive situations. The latter prompted the company to hire thousands more human moderators to review content for potential policy violations.\n\nBut it has since become obvious that YouTube\u2019s problems aren\u2019t simply a matter of manpower. They flow from the company\u2019s confusion about the nature of its business and the extent of its responsibilities.\n\n.@SusanWojcicki \"If there is an important news event we want to be delivering the right information.\"\n\n\n\nMinutes later she says, \"We are not a news organization.\" \u2014 Ryan Mac (@RMac18) March 13, 2018\n\nIn February, YouTube\u2019s algorithms boosted conspiracy videos attacking the children who survived the Parkland, Florida, school massacre. This month, influential YouTube conspiracy theorist Alex Jones claimed the company was about to delete his channel, a claim YouTube said was not true. Writing in the New York Times this week, the tech scholar Zeynep Tufekci called YouTube \u201cthe great radicalizer,\u201d detailing how its recommendation algorithm carries casual viewers down rabbit holes of extremism.\n\nAt South by Southwest on Tuesday, Wojcicki came prepared with a new plan to tackle conspiracy videos on YouTube. But the subsequent reaction suggested she hadn\u2019t come quite prepared enough.\n\nPointing to slides that displayed YouTube videos purveying conspiracies about the moon landing and chemtrails, Wojcicki said the company will begin displaying \u201cinformation cues\u201d drawn from Wikipedia alongside such clips. The cues come in the form of little blocks of text directly below the video. To determine which videos require such a counterweight, Wojcicki said, YouTube will draw on Wikipedia\u2019s own list of well-known conspiracy theories. She noted that YouTube could expand on that list over time.\n\nThis was all news to the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that administers the volunteer-edited Wikipedia. \u201cWe were not given advance notice of this announcement,\u201d the foundation said in a statement Wednesday, adding that there is no formal partnership between it and YouTube. While it did not explicitly object to YouTube using its content in this way, the nonprofit stressed that it relies on donors and unpaid editors, and that it \u201cdoes not control content or make editorial decisions about information that is included on Wikipedia.\u201d\n\nIn other words, an $800 billion company\u2014arguably the world\u2019s most important information source\u2014is outsourcing the job of combatting misinformation on its platform to a nonprofit built on free labor. And it didn\u2019t bother to tell them.\n\nEven if YouTube had handled this better, it\u2019s not clear that Wikipedia cards will do much to solve its problems. The approach is loosely analogous to one that Facebook began deploying in December 2016 to fight fake news. But Facebook later ditched its initial approach amid concerns that it might be backfiring (a finding that is itself disputed by some). After a year\u2019s worth of research, testing, and trial and error, there\u2019s been little evidence so far that the social network\u2019s efforts have made much difference in the spread of misinformation. That\u2019s one reason Facebook has simultaneously pursued several other avenues to improve the quality and credibility of news and information on its platform\u2014some more promising than others.\n\nOne rather glaring problem with YouTube\u2019s plan is that it seems ill-equipped to handle conspiracies that crop up rapidly in the wake of major news events such as the Parkland shooting. Those memes\u2014such as the one smearing Parkland survivor David Hogg as a \u201ccrisis actor\u201d\u2014are liable to make the rounds on YouTube well before they\u2019ve been authoritatively debunked on Wikipedia, let alone added to a master list of well-known conspiracies. Even with human moderators on hand, some of these conspiracy theories have scaled to the top of YouTube\u2019s prominent list of trending videos, and earned millions of views in the process, before being taken down.\n\nAnother issue: Wikipedia is vulnerable to trolls and propagandists, just as is any other platform that relies on the public to produce and curate content. It might become more so, now that people know Wikipedia holds the keys to YouTube\u2019s conspiracy-debunking apparatus, such as it is. One prominent Wikipedia editor was quick to warn that YouTube\u2019s misinformation problems run deeper than anything that could be solved by an \u201cirregularly updated *encyclopedia*.\u201d\n\n...huh.\n\n\n\n1) ok, seems fine. Hope they credit us appropriately\n\n2) I don't think YouTube can rely on our irregularly updated *encyclopedia* to solve its ranking algorithm/hate speech issue; ppl don't read refs.\n\n3) web 2.0 is wierd, man.\n\n\n\n/goes back to working on Wikipedia articles https://t.co/f9G1JZLTu2 \u2014 Phoebe Ayers (@phoebe_ayers) March 14, 2018\n\nOn the same day that Wojcicki was taking the stage in Austin on Tuesday to announce her big fix, a YouTube spokesperson was telling Vice News that the company had no idea why an InfoWars conspiracy video was topping its search results Monday for queries about the package explosions in Austin. The InfoWars video claimed, without evidence, that Antifa was a \u201cprime suspect\u201d in the bombings.\n\nIn the same speech, according to tweets by BuzzFeed News\u2019 Ryan Mac, Wired editor-in-chief Nick Thompson asked Wojcicki how YouTube decides which information sources are credible. Wojcicki declined to get specific, saying \u201cthere are usually complicated algorithms\u201d\u2014the sort of vague excuse that Facebook shopped for years before critics largely stopped buying it. She did suggest, however, that YouTube looks at the \u201cnumber of journalistic awards\u201d and \u201camount of traffic\u201d that various publishers have. If that\u2019s true, those are some awfully crude, extremely amateurish proxies\u2014more so even than Facebook\u2019s widely ridiculed publisher trust survey.\n\nIt appears, then, that YouTube is just beginning the journey of reckoning that Facebook was compelled by critics (and its own outraged employees) to undertake almost immediately after the 2016 election. Part of that journey will probably involve learning some humility: Just last month Wojcicki sniped at a media conference in California that Facebook \u201cshould get back to baby pictures,\u201d the implication being that it couldn\u2019t handle the grown-up responsibilities of a prominent news platform. One could imagine a similar dig at YouTube, perhaps swapping out baby pictures for cat videos.\n\nThe reality is that none of these platforms is going back to its comparatively innocent early days. Social media, for better or worse, has firmly established itself as a primary news source for huge swaths of the population, with younger generations leading that trend. That means YouTube, like Facebook and Twitter, is stuck with the responsibility of figuring out how to do a better job of informing its users. Excuses like the one Google\u2019s Richard Salgado offered to Congress in October\u2014that the company is a \u201ctechnology platform\u201d and therefore not in the news business\u2014no longer fly.\n\nIt\u2019s good to see YouTube finally beginning to acknowledge that it has a problem. The next step is for it to understand that solving that problem won\u2019t be easy, and quick fixes won\u2019t suffice. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg indicated in January that he understood fixing his platform will require a sustained, long-term effort. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said as much in a tweetstorm earlier this month. To judge from Wojcicki\u2019s recent comments, YouTube isn\u2019t quite there yet.", "title": "YouTube is only just realizing that it might be bad for all of us."}, {"url": "http://www.wpxi.com/news/national-news/ap-top-news/fourlegged-fugitive-big-lizard-escapes-california-pet-shop/712710011", "content": "Sign in using you account with: {* loginWidget *}\n\nSign in using your wpxi profile\n\nWelcome back.

Good morning.\n\nJen from Centennial, CO\n\nSorry to see Jordy go. Great guy. What's your favorite Jordy memory?\n\nToo many to count. His breakthrough performance in Super Bowl XLV. His 60-yard game-winning catch in Chicago. When the Jets had absolutely no answer for him during his 209-yard performance in 2014. My favorite interview with him was last year coming back from the ACL tear. Nelson doesn\u2019t like to talk about himself, but you could tell how much it meant to him to get back on the field. That\u2019s a tough road for a receiver north of 30 years old. What he did in 2016 will go down as one of the most remarkable comebacks in Packers history.\n\nTom from Dunkerton, IA\n\nThe Gutekunst era has officially begun.\n\nTuesday was an active day for the Packers, but trust me, Brian Gutekunst doesn\u2019t make these moves hastily. This is the culmination of months of debate inside those meeting rooms.\n\nBrian from Cameron, WI\n\nDays like this are one of the few where I don't envy your job. Jordy will be deeply missed. Keep up the good work, Insiders!\n\nIt doesn\u2019t compare to what these personnel guys go through on a daily basis. The confidence and moxie those individuals have to sign, release and draft players is off the charts. There are no \u201coverall\u201d ratings to go off of like Madden. It\u2019s all instinct and intuition.\n\nJason from Billings, MT\n\nI was elated to see that the Pack plan to sign Graham, but then looked at my phone 20 minutes later to see they cut Jordy. Free agency is a cruel mistress.\n\nJordy Nelson was more than just a receiver to Packers fans. He was everything you could ask for in an ambassador of Packers football. He was a natural leader, even if he didn\u2019t want to be. Well-respected among his peers, Nelson was the Packers\u2019 NFLPA rep for years. He also is humble to a fault. We get tons of emails every day asking about players. Most fans will use last names to quickly reference players in a question or comment \u2013 Rodgers, Bakhtiari, Cobb, Daniels and Montgomery. Nelson was different. To fans, he was simply \u201cJordy.\u201d\n\nMatt from Roseville, MI\n\nWith the Packers cutting Jordy, do you see a replacement on the roster, will they draft one or the possibility of bringing him back on a smaller deal? He was one of my favorite players, sad to see a player of his quality let go.\n\nThe Packers have talented players in the pipeline. Geronimo Allison , Trevor Davis , Michael Clark and DeAngelo Yancey have a golden opportunity in front of them. However, no one player can fill the shoes of Jordy Nelson. He\u2019s a rare breed and I wish him well in whatever the future holds, both personally and professionally.\n\nGreg from Perkasie, PA\n\nJordy was my all-time favorite player. As a fan, it sucks seeing him get cut even more because the majority of his last season was without Rodgers. The connection they had on the field was incredible and I will miss watching it.\n\nWhat those two had was something special. You can\u2019t coach that kind of chemistry. Their decade run together was the longest active partnership between a quarterback and receiver in the NFL. If you\u2019d indulge me, I\u2019d like to share probably my favorite quote from Rodgers about his relationship with Nelson. It\u2019s from an interview I did with him in October 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dry, cerebral-type of humor between the two of us. \u2026 I think we\u2019re both small-town guys. I grew up in small towns across Northern California and he grew up in a small town in Kansas. We both believe in hard work paying off and trying to play this game, and beat people with your brain a lot of times.\u201d Man, did they do a lot of that over the years. They played the game at a higher level than most.\n\nKenton from Rochester, MN\n\nI'm sure your Inbox is flooded with outrage over Jordy's release. And I guess you could include me as well. However, to be fair to Gutekunst, what are the positives of this move? Is it to clear cap space?\n\nIt was strictly a dollars-and-cents move. The Packers needed space and parting ways with Nelson was what the front office felt was the lesser of all evils.\n\nAndy from Walpole, MA\n\nMan, it really is a business, isn't it? Well, we'll miss him and we'll wish him the best wherever he goes. I can't think of a personnel move by the Packers in all the years I've been following them that seems as wrong as this one.\n\nThere\u2019s no question this one stings, but I\u2019d also remind you the Packers once traded a Hall of Fame quarterback to move forward with a relatively unproven Aaron Rodgers . You don\u2019t know until you know, Andy.\n\nMatt from Waunakee, WI\n\nI remember the day Jordy Nelson was drafted. They interviewed the Kansas State coach on TV, he said \"You are going to love that kid up there.\" He could not have been more right. I think I'll enjoy a big bowl of Jordy Flakes this morning.\n\nHe hit it right on the head and Jordy Flakes were pretty good, by the way. I had a box or two myself in my kitchen cabinet.\n\nDonny from Green Bay, WI\n\nIs the release of Nelson a smokescreen, like when the Packers cut A.J. Hawk a few years ago, only to re-sign him the next day at a lower number?\n\nThe Packers cut Hawk in 2011 because of a salary issue related to the final year of his rookie contract, which stemmed from his fifth-overall selection in the pre-CBA era. Ted Thompson even said in the news release announcing the move that Green Bay was \u201chopeful that we can continue to work with\u201d him. This move with Nelson seems more finite.\n\nMark from Illinois\n\nAny chance Jordy gets a new contract?\n\nGutekunst said it\u2019s unlikely at the moment. However, it is worth pointing out James Jones eventually made his way back to Green Bay. \u201cNever say never.\u201d\n\nJoe from Kansas City, MO\n\nWell, Cliff Christl's article on Lombardi being willing to let players go was timely. The decision to let Jordy go may make cap sense, but it's not going to be popular.\n\nThese decisions never are.\n\nJohn from Henderson, KY\n\nGood afternoon. I can only imagine how flooded the Inbox is today. Putting all my emotions aside, I\u2019m curious what factors go into cutting Jordy Nelson rather than trading him for draft picks or another player? I didn\u2019t know if it has something to do with his contract status, or if a trade for another player or pick puts the Packers in an unfavorable condition. Best of luck to Jordy. I\u2019ll sure miss seeing him in green and gold, as will my dog. His name is also Jordy.\n\nYou think you know, but you have no idea. Comments were trickling in throughout the day before news broke\u2026and then earthquake. It\u2019s not as simple to trade a player as some might think. The reality is Nelson will turn 33 in May and is coming off a year in which he had 482 receiving yards in 15 games. Teams prefer to structure their own deals rather than absorbing pre-existing contracts.\n\nTinger from Red Wing, MN\n\nJordy is gone because he made a huge salary last year and gave up when Rodgers got hurt. You cannot do that in this league. He\u2019s been great, will make the Packers HOF in a cakewalk, but he failed to step it up when they needed him to.\n\nThis is the most foolish thing I\u2019ve read. Say what you want about how the season ended for the Packers, but I can assure you Nelson didn\u2019t give up. I mean 14 months ago he played with broken ribs. The guy was the heartbeat of that locker room. He put it on the line each time he stepped on the field. Give up? Give me a break.\n\nDave from Sturgeon Bay, WI\n\nLast name is Nielsen. Named the dog Jordy. We thought that was cute. Not sure what to do now. I\u2019m kinda bummed out.\n\nHey, Jordy Nielsen isn\u2019t going anywhere. Be sure to give him an extra treat today.\n\nRyan from Menomonie, WI\n\nNo matter how much you love the guy and all he stands for, it's still a business, right?\n\nThat\u2019s the unfortunate truth of the matter.\n\nMike from Jacksonville, NC\n\nI guess if you want your team to be more aggressive in free agency, you can\u2019t expect to keep every fan favorite.\n\nAs another commenter \u2013 Scott from Miamisburg, OH \u2013 wrote in last night \u2013 business just got real.\n\nFred from La Crosse, WI\n\nI\u2019ve been an admirer of No. 87 from the time he was drafted. I am hoping the best for him. When a player is released what is the upside for them?\n\nThey\u2019re free to sign wherever they so choose. Nelson, for the first time in his career, is a free agent.\n\nPeter from Madison, WI\n\nYou thought you were done with questions about No. 88 didn\u2019t you?\n\nI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\n\nLeo from Kenosha, WI\n\nWhy do I have to go to the NFL site to get the newest news on the Packers? I would think this site would be the first place to get the news, but I see we waived Nelson and are expected to sign Graham. Not even mentioned on here as of yet. Why, I just don\u2019t get it?\n\nNFL teams aren\u2019t permitted to announce unrestricted free-agent signings until the new league year begins at 3 p.m. CT Wednesday. That\u2019s why Gutekunst wouldn\u2019t address any Damarious Randall questions Tuesday. So hold your horses, Uncle Leo. I will say Graham is a unique talent. Paraphrasing an old Ted Thompson quote, the good lord just didn\u2019t create a whole lot of men who are 6-foot-7, 265 pounds. His track record speaks for itself.\n\nRob from Lafayette, IN\n\nThat D-line, though.\n\nThe Packers used a beefed-up D-line to spur their last defensive turnaround in 2009. This has the makings to follow in those footsteps. Business is about to pick up.\n\nEarl from Cheboygan, MI\n\nWhat is Jeff Janis \u2019 status with GB?\n\nHe\u2019ll be an unrestricted free agent in a few hours. That\u2019s all that\u2019s really known at the moment. There are levels to free agency. It may take some time for Janis\u2019 situation to sort itself out.\n\nDaniel from Eau Claire, WI\n\nAre these next few days an equivalent to journalism hell for sports writers (specifically NFL Network and ESPN writers)? With what's shaping up to be the most active NFL free agency ever, the baseball season starting to heat up, March Madness kicking off, and last and very much least, the beginning of the MLS season. Do sports writers even think about sleep in times like these?\n\nI didn\u2019t. I always was restless. My favorite memory has to be sitting at the kitchen table of espn.com\u2019s Rob Demovsky, my former colleague at the Press-Gazette, in March 2015. I think Bryan Bualga had just re-signed with the Packers, which made for an already long day. I was just about to head home for the night when news broke that Randall Cobb had signed a new four-year deal. So I left Rob\u2019s and headed back to the Press-Gazette office. I wrote that story on like a 20-minute deadline, I believe. The opening day of free agency and night before the final roster reduction were always the two nights I slept the least.\n\nCody from Wisconsin Dells, WI\n\nDoes not having a strong chance at substantial compensatory picks in next year\u2019s draft factor in deciding to sign more free agents this offseason?\n\nThere also have been years when the Packers only lost one significant unrestricted free agent (Casey Hayward in 2016) and still opted to go the way of \u201cstreet\u201d free agents (Jared Cook and Lerentee McCray). This doesn\u2019t appear to be one of those years, though.\n\nJason from Sioux Center, IA\n\nNo question, just a comment: While it hurts to see a guy like Jordy go, and only time will tell if Gute was right, I am encouraged to see that he has the guts to make an unpopular decision if he believes it will benefit the team.\n\nThere\u2019s always a price to improve. Never forget that.\n\nRick from Des Moines, IA\n\nWhat are fans more nervous about during the year, before free agency, before the draft, or before the start of the season?\n\nBefore the season, before free agency and before the draft in that order.\n\nGeorge from North Mankato, MN\n\nIf reports are correct, the Vikings will sign Kirk Cousins to a lucrative contract. More interesting is that they look to be losing three free agent QBs this offseason. Has this ever happened before?\n\nNot for the combined amount of money Sam Bradford, Case Keenum and Teddy Bridgewater reportedly are going to sign for. Monopoly money getting thrown around.\n\nDon from Cedar Rapids, IA\n\nThe Packers gave me very little confidence in their third-down defense last season, whether in short-, medium- or long-yardage situations. How did they end up ranking last year in third-down defense? What do they need to do to improve?\n\nThe Packers finished 28th in third-down defense. I\u2019d say they need more pressure on the quarterback and across-the-board improvement on defending the screen. This D-line could be an X-factor, though.\n\nNicholas from Portland, OR\n\nI know people aren\u2019t high on Kizer, but I watched a highlight reel of his rookie season and the kid can ball. He made some really strong throws (including a few against the Packers). Of course I didn\u2019t see the bad, which I suspect was pretty awful given the winless season, but to me his ceiling looks really high.\n\nKizer was a second-round pick for a reason. He has the talent. A few years ago, people weren\u2019t high on Alex Smith and Case Keenum, either. Now, they\u2019re two of the highest-paid quarterbacks in the game. Experience is the most powerful teacher. Let the guy get some.\n\nRuss from Billings, MT\n\nGentlemen, with Joe Callahan being tendered, one has to believe that the powers must have more faith in him than we were led to believe in 2017. Might there be a three-way competition for the backup job going on after the disappointment last year?\n\nThe Packers did one-year deals with most of their practice-squad signings last season. Tendering Callahan or any of the 10 free agents with fewer than three accrued seasons is just a formality. Callahan has been in the system for (most of) the past two years and deserves a chance to compete.\n\nPat from Howell, NJ\n\nIf the Browns take a QB at No. 1, would you consider trading up with the Giants at No. 2 to select Saquon Barkley despite having Aaron Jones , Jamaal Williams and Ty Montgomery at RB? The Packers have the most picks in the draft (12) and the Giants have the fewest (five).\n\nNo, because the Packers likely would need to move picks from next year\u2019s draft to make it happen. The draft-value chart says New York\u2019s No. 2 pick is worth 2,600 points. The value of all the Packers\u2019 2018 picks combined? 2,002.5.\n\nRobert from Saint Joseph, MI\n\nDo you think there will ever be an NHL or college hockey game played at Lambeau Field?\n\nThere already has been a men\u2019s college hockey game played at Lambeau Field. The University of Wisconsin hosted Ohio State on Feb. 11, 2006. NHL? Maybe someday.\n\nAl from Green Bay, WI\n\nMy phone keeps buzzing with alerts of the latest multi-million dollar free-agent deal. Between that and the occasional work interruption, how am I supposed to get my bracket done?\n\nThe struggle is real.\n\nSean from DeSoto, TX\n\nMike took time off again didn't he\u2026\n\nNo, this time I did\u2026and I paid for it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHAVE A QUESTION?", "title": "Jordy Nelson was more than just a receiver"}, {"url": "https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/974307574630805504", "content": "Tweet with a location\n\nYou can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

A giant American flag hangs above the stage at the center of the hall. \"All rise,\" says a clerk, and between 3,000 and 5,000 applicants for citizenship rise from their stackable chairs. Beyond them, another few thousand friends and relatives also stand. A black-robed judge takes his or her place behind a podium and leads the applicants through the Oath of Allegiance, some version of which has been required of new citizens since the country's first Naturalization Act was passed in 1790. \"I hereby declare,\" the oath begins, \"that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty.\" Once the applicants have sworn \"to bear true faith\" to \"the Constitution and the laws of the United States,\" and to take up arms on its behalf when required, each judge delivers a brief welcoming speech. \"We are a society of freedom,\" promised Judge Andr\u00e9 Birotte Jr. at a ceremony in October, \"where your dreams and aspirations will come true.\"\n\nRelated Jamil Smith: Jeff Sessions Is Suing California, and I Feel Fine It's easy to see why the Golden State would want this fight over immigration\n\nIt is at that point in the ceremony that an enormous image of the president's face takes shape on the screens at each side of the stage. Trump's eyes are squinted, his teeth even and small. He reads from a teleprompter, biting off the words: \"No matter where you come from or what faith you practice, this country is now your country.\" He makes it sound like a threat. At every ceremony I attended, applause for the video was sparse, but many of the people in the hall were there because of Trump. I interviewed dozens of them. Nearly half said that Trump's election had been a factor in their decision to seek citizenship. Sitting next to me at the ceremony in October was a man from El Salvador named Diego Ortiz. He told me he decided to seek citizenship after the election for a very practical reason: out of fear. \"I don't know what it's going to be like in a month,\" he confided.\n\nOrtiz had arrived in the U.S. in 1989, shortly before his third birthday. An aunt carried him over the border; his mother and brother had fled El Salvador's civil war two years earlier. In 1990, Congress granted Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, to Salvadorans like the Ortizes, allowing them to live and work here legally while it was unsafe to go home. He remembered waiting for hours with his mother in cold federal offices as she re-registered for TPS each year. After decades of anxiety, many missteps and thousands of dollars lost to fraudulent lawyers, Ortiz and his parents were granted permanent residency. Their trajectory is the sort that we talk about when we speak of the American Dream: His father found work as a landscaper and his mother cleaned houses, but Ortiz finished college and now works for an environmental advocacy group in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nAfter Ortiz picked up his naturalization certificate and joined 3,419 other newly minted citizens filing slowly out of the Convention Center, the court broke for lunch and convened again promptly at 1:30 p.m. to swear in another 3,542 people. For most of American history, all of this \u2013 the pageantry and the vast bureaucracy behind it \u2013 would have been unimaginable. In 1885, when the president's grandfather, Friedrich Trumpf \u2013 his family had already transitioned from Drumpf \u2013 sailed into New York Harbor from Germany, Ellis Island had not yet opened. There was no federal immigration department and no border patrol. Visitors were not expected to carry passports or visas. To most Americans, the notion of an \"illegal immigrant\" would have elicited confusion. Young Trumpf likely faced a cursory examination to make sure he was not a \"convict, lunatic, idiot.\" Then his name and age were recorded in a handwritten ledger along with his \"calling\": \"none.\"\n\nToday, the portion of Americans born abroad is roughly the same as it was then \u2013 about 13 percent. Little else remains the same. There are A visas and O visas now, SQs and H1-Bs. There are more than 15,000 immigration lawyers trained to navigate an almost impossibly complex array of laws and procedures administered and enforced by the 100,000 employees of three federal agencies with a combined budget of up to $27 billion. They are the ones who decide who to keep out, who to let in and, quite literally, who we as a nation may yet become. They run a machine made up of courtrooms and offices in hundreds of federal buildings around the country, of cells in both government-owned and private prisons, of fleets of vans for transporting prisoners and SUVs that patrol the border as well as streets and neighborhoods hundreds of miles from it. The machine functions to sort humans into piles \u2013\u00ad ejecting some, granting some full acceptance, condemning others to a life at the margins. It helps to produce, and enforce, the unacknowledged caste system that orders our society. Last year, it deported 226,119 people, granted permanent residency to over a million others and citizenship to 703,000 more.\n\nThe machine answers now to Trump, but it was Obama who perfected its deportation apparatus, ejecting nearly 3 million immigrants during his two terms. We owe much of its infrastructure, from an expanding detention system to the legal framework underpinning most detentions and deportations, to Bill Clinton. Whatever they say on the campaign trail, whether they promise inclusion and a path to citizenship or shout about anchor babies and MS-13, politicians of both parties have stoked it and maintained it \u2013 and the social hierarchy that it perpetuates \u2013 with meticulous care. No matter the rhetoric, the machine continues to hum. It hums when the conversation gives way to shouting, and it keeps humming when the pundits move on to other things. But to the human beings caught up in its workings, it feels less like a machine than a huge and fickle monster, by turns generous, petty, merciless and cruel.\n\nBut rhetoric matters. Trump ran for office in large part on a promise to keep immigrants out. As a result, the national conversation on immigration has never in recent memory been more panicked, divisive and calculated to spread fear in immigrants and citizens alike. In the 14 months since his inauguration, Trump has been unable to achieve any of his legislative goals on immigration, but he has nonetheless had a powerful impact, sharply restricting travel from six Muslim-majority nations; rescinding an Obama-era policy that allowed 800,000 immigrants who arrived in the United States as children to live and work without fear of deportation; terminating the Temporary Protected Status that permitted nearly 300,000 Central Americans and Haitians to live in this country with some measure of security; and unleashing Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to stage ever-more spectacular, punitive and headline-grabbing arrests. The crackdown has been particularly harsh in California, which is home to a quarter of the country's immigrants.\n\nTrump's policies have provoked fear and uncertainty at every rank of the ladder \u2013 from the relatively privileged to the absolutely excluded, from those for whom the security of citizenship will come easily to those for whom it will remain a distant dream. What follows is a snapshot of the machine, a portrait of the monster, told through the lives of five residents of Los Angeles county, revealing how their fortunes and their dreams have changed since Trump took office, and what sort of a country we are becoming.\n\nStefan Ruiz\n\nThe Door Swings Open\n\n\"I sort of feel guilty,\" Helen Kennedy confessed the first time we spoke. \"I know how lucky I am.\" That was July. Three months earlier her dad had fetched her Green Card from the mailbox \u2013 in his underwear, she laughed \u2013 outside her parents' home in Dorset, in southwest England. Six months before that, her husband, Kai, who was born in New York, had filed the first of many forms to request permanent residency in the United States on her behalf. That would have been an I-130 form: \"Petition for Alien Relative.\" When the alien in question happens to be a spouse, a solid I-130, one Los Angeles immigration lawyer told me, is \"like the platinum card.\" There is no smoother path to living legally as a foreigner in the United States. The dangers of \"horrible chain migration,\" to borrow the president's phrase, have become a common Republican talking point \u2013 the White House proposed continuing to allow citizens to sponsor their spouses and kids, but not their parents, adult children or siblings. Ironically, the family-unification provisions of U.S. immigration law were originally instituted as a gift to the nativist right. The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act ushered out per-country quotas but attempted to maintain the country's then overwhelmingly white majority by freely granting citizenship to the immediate family of existing U.S. citizens, most of whom were of European ancestry.\n\nKennedy is 37 and tall, with striking blue eyes and blond hair that tumbles to her shoulders. She had been to the U.S. several times as a kid, to Orlando. \"It was the Nineties, so obviously mum and dad had a timeshare.\" Her father, a partner in an accounting firm, fantasized about moving to Florida for good, but however sun-deprived she sometimes felt, it never occurred to Kennedy that she might end up in the States.\n\nShe and Kai met in 2010, at a pub. He is even taller than she is and as reserved as she is chatty. He had been in London for nearly a decade, doing web design. She was acting, doing improv, writing. They dated, moved in together, got tired of the London party scene and moved to a quaint commuter town. But quaint also meant stodgy, and they didn't fit in. In 2015, Kennedy flew for the first time to Los Angeles. The weather was gorgeous, of course, and she met with writers and producers and found a manager who wanted to work with her. She and Kai began to talk about leaving England. The next summer they were married. In September 2016, Kai filed that I-130. \"Oh, well,\" Kennedy thought, \"it might not work out, but let's give it a little bash. If it doesn't, we'll still have a lovely life here.\"\n\nLast February, Kai found a job, moved to L.A. and started looking for an apartment. In March, the day came for Kennedy's interview at the U.S. embassy in London. She looked down and saw that her hands were shaking. She had expected something formal, she said, \"an officious-looking man in a suit in the middle of a room with a clock ticking,\" but the official who interviewed her was quite friendly. It was \"almost like a fun and lighthearted conversation.\" In less than 15 minutes, it was over. He told her that she had been accepted and could expect her Green Card to arrive within two weeks.\n\nKennedy left the embassy with mixed emotions. Before her interview, she said, she had struck up a conversation with a family in the waiting room, a young couple with a little boy. They were applying for visas to visit the U.S. She didn't know where they were from, she said, but she knew they were Muslims, and she knew that the Trump administration had been trying to keep Muslims out of the U.S. The woman was fully veiled, with only her eyes showing. \"She had beautiful eyes, these big, brown, loving eyes.\" In the short time that they sat together, Kennedy said, \"we had a really in-depth conversation about our life plans, about California.\" The husband, a doctor, spoke \"very eloquently about California, the smell of the pine trees, just the abundance of nature.\" She watched them go in for their interview and come out a few minutes later, downcast. Things had apparently gone poorly. She didn't talk to them again and never learned exactly what happened, but the contrast between their fortunes and hers unnerved her. Telling the story three months later, she wiped away a tear. \"I feel quite guilty,\" she told me. \"I know how different it can be.\"\n\nStefan Ruiz\n\nThe Line Is Long\n\nSwati Narang came to the U.S. 12 years ago from India with her father and a younger sister. She was 20 then. Her dad was a programmer and had been offered a job by a tech company in Southern California. His employer applied for a visa on his behalf, an H-1B, which allows companies to sponsor individuals with \"specialized knowledge\" necessary for their work. It may not be the golden ticket, but the H-1B at least opens the door. It must be renewed every three years and, with a petition from the applicant's boss, can be a step toward the security of a Green Card. With so much power in the hands of employers, accounts of abuse aren't hard to find. Still, H-1B holders, most of whom work in the tech sector, generally do extremely well. Their average salary is more than $90,000. During the presidential campaign, Trump promised to \"institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers\" and to \"end forever the use of the H-1B.\" (He also at various times appeared to support the program, and to not understand what it is.) Already though, only 85,000 H-1Bs are awarded each year; applications wildly outnumber available slots, and the government distributes them by lottery.\n\nMoving here, Narang said, \"the first thing that hits you is loneliness.\" She had grown up in what she describes as \"a very small town\" in Punjab, surrounded by extended family. She knew no one in L.A. Her Indian bachelor's degree, she learned, wouldn't be recognized here, so she enrolled at Cal State to make up the required coursework. \"Since then,\" she said, \"I've never had the free time to think about it.\" She earned a master's in taxation and found a job as an accountant. When her post-graduation training period expired \u2013 foreign students are generally permitted to work for a year after completing their studies \u2013 her boss petitioned for an H-1B.\n\n\"The feeling of waiting in the long queues is awful. Your remaining life is in the hands of this person who is standing on the other side of the window.\"\n\nShe never expected to stay here, Narang said, but with time \"it felt like a much better way to live.\" In the town where she grew up, \"the female is supposed to look after the home and nurture and all that. I love independence.\" Her eyes lit up at the word. Without planning to, she put down roots. She married, had a son, divorced and married again. Four years ago, she took a job with LegalZoom, the online legal-services company, where she works as a \"product analytics manager\" \u2013 something to do with marketing, she explained \u2013 again on an H-1B. She and her husband, who is also Indian and here on an H-1B, bought a house in Moorpark, in the outer bands of suburban L.A. She bought a Tesla too, and likes to drive it fast. She made sure to teach her son Hindi, but he otherwise sounds like a very American boy. He prefers basketball to soccer and shuttles after school between tae kwon do and swim lessons. Last year, at Narang's request, LegalZoom petitioned for a Green Card for her. She expects to wait, she sighed, \"forever.\" (I spoke with several of her co-workers who were also Indians on H-1Bs; they had been waiting for between four and six years.)\n\nBut anxiety is in the air. Last April, Trump issued an executive order instructing Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a fierce critic of H-1Bs, and the secretaries of labor, state, and homeland security to \"suggest reforms\" to the program. Many tech executives, some of whom are immigrants themselves, insist they cannot find enough qualified American workers to stay competitive. In the meantime, the administration appears to be doing what it can to gum up the process: The number of H-1B applications challenged by the government is up 45 percent. \"You keep hearing about it,\" Narang told me. \"People are getting stuck.\"\n\nNarang did her best to convince me that she has no political opinions whatsoever and isn't concerned about the future, but the first time we spoke, she was more forthright. \"I'm so sick to my heart with the whole process,\" she said. On her last trip to India, she said, she had been required to go to the U.S. embassy in Delhi for an interview before getting her visa stamped. \"The feeling of waiting in the long queues is awful,\" she said. \"You can see when people are accepted and you can see when they are rejected.\" She had plenty of time to observe which immigration agents seemed lenient and which seemed harsh, and to wonder if she had chosen the wrong line. Three people ahead of her were rejected. \"Your remaining life is in the hands of this person who is standing on the other side of the window.\" Her husband made it through and went outside to wait for her, and pray. When she couldn't remember the date of her college graduation, she briefly feared that she wouldn't be allowed to return. \"If they deny me, what am I supposed to do, start my life over?\"\n\nStefan Ruiz\n\nThe Door Swings Shut\n\nWhen Patrick Dela Cruz was 11 years old, his mother told him they were going to Disneyland. He had just finished sixth grade in the Philippine countryside, about 60 miles outside of Manila. The trip, she said, would be his graduation present. He had never been in a car before, much less an airplane, so it goes without saying that Disneyland was a blast. He was excited to get home to tell his classmates about it, but the weeks soon turned to months and they were still in California. Only later did he figure out that they had never planned to return.\n\n\n\nThat was 10 years ago. He enrolled in middle school in Carson, in the working-class flats south of L.A. His adolescence was a lonely one. He didn't speak English, which made it hard to make friends. His mother, like his aunts and many other Filipinos, found work doing in-home care for the elderly, so he only saw her on weekends. He was in 10th grade when she was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer and decided to fly home to the Philippines to spend what time she had left with her family. Dela Cruz made what he describes as the hardest decision of his life: to stay. The last time he spoke with his mother, on Skype, he said, \"She was apologizing for not being everything I wanted. I told her, 'You've given me everything. You've given me an opportunity.'\"\n\n\n\nIf he had been born 15 years earlier, Dela Cruz might have easily joined the thousands who are sworn in as citizens each month. Until 1996, if you had been in the country for at least seven years and could prove that you would suffer \"extreme hardship\" if deported, you could apply for permanent residency. But Bill Clinton signed an immigration-reform bill that year that made legalization all but impossible for most, consigning Dela Cruz and millions of others to the shadows. When he graduated from high school, he learned that he was not eligible for federal financial aid or government-backed loans. He had planned to apply to college, but was told that he would have to enroll as an international student, which would push the cost of tuition far out of his reach. He couldn't work legally either, or drive a car. For nearly two years, he was in limbo, and depressed. \"I felt useless,\" he said. He went to the recruitment center at a nearby mall and tried enlisting in the military, but the recruiters wouldn't take him. He was crying as he left the mall.\n\n\"There's always that fear that at any time somebody can come knocking and take you away.\"\n\nFortunately, one of his aunts learned about DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the policy instituted by the Obama administration in 2012 to offer temporary protection to immigrants who had arrived in the U.S. as children. If Clinton-era reforms had relegated a vast segment of the population to a ghostly state of official non-existence, DACA would give some relief to the so-called Dreamers, kids like de la Cruz who effectively knew no other country. It provided the most tenuous protection. The federal government was committing only to not deporting DACA recipients for renewable periods of two years at a time, and to allowing them to work and drive.\n\nFor de la Cruz, it was a godsend. Suddenly he could afford to go to school. He got a job in a clothing store, and then a tea shop, and devoted himself to his studies. He became vice president of the Asian students association, joined a student group of undocumented immigrants, another for LGBTQ kids, and an off-campus advocacy group for Filipino migrants. He allowed himself to think about the future. His bachelor's would be in health and fitness, but he could go to graduate school and get a master's, or even a doctorate, in physical therapy. Still, DACA could be rescinded in an instant. \"There's always that fear,\" he said, \"that at any time somebody can come knocking and take you away.\"\n\nTrump's election hit hard. Everything Dela Cruz had achieved, he knew, might be taken from him. \"I feel like my confidence has been stripped away,\" he told me last June. Early in September, four days before Jeff Sessions made it official, Dela Cruz heard that Trump had decided to repeal DACA. He spent the weekend in his room, feeling hopeless. That Monday he sat in his kinesiology class with two windows open on his laptop: one for his lecture notes and the other to watch Sessions insist that \"we are a people of compassion and we are a people of law.\" Trump would allow DACA to expire in March 2018, and with it the hopes of 700,000 young, undocumented Americans. \"It's heartbreaking,\" Dela Cruz said. \"You give hope to someone and you just tear it up and take it away.\"\n\nDela Cruz had already renewed his status before the attorney general's announcement, so if Trump keeps his word, he should be safe from deportation until June of 2019. But Dela Cruz saw little reason to trust the authorities. Applying for DACA had been a risk. It meant coming out from the shadows and telling the government that you were here, and where you lived. \"They have my information in the system,\" Dela Cruz said. Still, whatever the risks, he intends to speak out as much as he possibly can. \"I've been silent,\" he said, \"having the benefit of working and being able to go to school, but that's being taken away. I can't be silent anymore.\"\n\nStefan Ruiz\n\nThe Bolt Is Locked\n\nThree flags fly in the parking lot of the Adelanto ICE Processing Center: the stars and stripes, the California state flag, and a green, white and blue banner bearing the logo of the GEO Group, one of the country's largest private prison firms. R\u00f3mulo Av\u00e9lica-Gonz\u00e1lez lived in Southern California for 26 years without knowing that this place existed, or suspecting that he would lose six months of his life to its walls. When I was finally able to meet him a few days after his release in September, he had the dazed and grateful look that I've encountered on the faces of disaster survivors, as if it had been a storm or an earthquake that had upended his family's life.\n\nAv\u00e9lica grew up in the Mexican state of Nayarit. What little work could be found there paid barely enough to eat, so in 1991, at 22, he jumped the border in Tijuana. Crossing was easier then, he told me, in Spanish. \"You just had to run really fast.\" (In 1994, the U.S. began increasing enforcement along urban sections of the border, pushing migrants into ever-more remote areas. Thousands have died in the desert since.) A few months later, his wife, Norma, followed him. She would give birth to four daughters, all of them U.S. citizens. Over the years, Av\u00e9lica did the sort of work that undocumented immigrants end up doing in L.A.: He worked at construction sites, for a food manufacturer, a produce distributor, and for the past five years as a cook in a taco shop not far from his home in the Eastside neighborhood of Lincoln Heights. He had two run-ins with the law. Unable to legally register his car, he used tags that a friend had given him, and in 1998 was pulled over and charged with a misdemeanor for receipt of stolen property. Ten years later, he was pulled over again and tested at just over the legal limit for a DUI.\n\nAt the beginning of 2017, those incidents were far from his mind. The Obama administration deported immigrants in far greater numbers than Trump has so far, but it did so with little fanfare. Under Obama's watch, ICE set a policy of avoiding arrests in \"sensitive locations\" such as churches and schools, but the Trump administration has ignored this guideline. After the election, news began spreading of arrests that seemed calculated to provoke panic: officers waiting outside churches, hauling people off in hospitals and courthouses, sending a clear message that nowhere was safe. In the first three months of Trump's presidency, arrests by deportation officers would leap 41 percent over the same period one year earlier.\n\nAv\u00e9lica continued his usual routine \u2013 going to work, taking his kids to school, picking them up from practice \u2013 only now he did it with fear. Always, he said, \"I felt uneasy.\" Still, on the morning of February 28th, 2017, when he noticed lights flashing in his rear-view mirror, Av\u00e9lica assumed it was the police, and that they were after someone else. He had just dropped his youngest daughter at school, and was on his way to drop off her sister, Fatima, who was then 13. The cars behind him were black and unmarked, the kind that swoop in for drug raids. When he pulled to the curb to let them pass, one swerved in front of him, boxing him in. Fatima, in the back seat, took out her phone and began shooting video. The footage is shaky, blurry through the windshield. You can see Av\u00e9lica in a green knit cap pushed up against the ICE officers' car. Mainly you hear Fatima's sobs. On YouTube, the video now has more than 600,000 views.\n\nWithout that video, Av\u00e9lica told me six months later, \"we wouldn't be sitting here.\" He would have been deported that day. But Trump's election brought about another change: organized resistance to immigration authorities with an efficiency that would have been hard to imagine a few months earlier. The ICE officers took Av\u00e9lica to a basement cell in the federal detention center in downtown L.A. His older daughters rushed over to visit him. He was crying, said Brenda, the eldest at 25. \"My dad doesn't cry.\" A little while later, a guard told him that in three hours he would be put in a van and driven to Tijuana. Despite his 26 years in the U.S., he was never given the phone number of an attorney or an advocacy group, or of anyone who could help him to mount some defense. In the meantime, though, the administration at his children's school had begun to mobilize, calling immigrant-rights groups, lawyers, elected officials. Fatima's video began to spread on social media. Protesters gathered outside the jail to block the vans from leaving. Just before they were scheduled to leave, Av\u00e9lica learned he wouldn't be going. Alan Diamante, the lawyer the school helped find for him, had filed an emergency stay with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Instead of south, to Mexico, he was driven 85 miles northeast, to Adelanto, on the edge of the Mojave Desert. This counted as a victory.\n\nThe criminal alien \u2013 the \"bad hombre\" in the president's words \u2013 has long been a figment of the racist imagination. Study after study has shown that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. Until the mid-1990s, the government rarely saw the need to imprison immigrants at all. But Clinton-era reforms instituted mandatory detention for all non-citizens convicted of a so-called aggravated felony, a category that included murder and rape but also many crimes that don't usually count as felonies under criminal law, like receiving stolen property, even just a license plate. At an annual cost of more than $2 billion, ICE now incarcerates as many as 400,000 immigrants a year in more than 200 county jails and private detention centers. The two largest private-prison corporations, the GEO Group and CoreCivic, have reaped enormous profits, and donate generously to politicians of both parties. In August 2016, Obama's Justice Department ordered a gradual phase-out of federal contracts with private prisons. GEO and CoreCivic stocks plummeted. The two corporations would together donate half a million dollars to Trump's inaugural committee, and hundreds of thousands more to Republican PACs. One month after Trump took office, Sessions rescinded the Obama order on private prisons. GEO and CoreCivic's investments seem to have paid off.\n\n\"I didn't know how long I would be there, but I knew I wouldn't last long,\" Av\u00e9lica recalled of his arrival at Adelanto. The food was meager. Av\u00e9lica suffers from diabetes. In the first two months, he lost 18 pounds. His head always hurt. He felt weak all the time. The prison doctor put him on medication, but it didn't help. Almost two years earlier, 29 members of Congress had signed a letter to ICE and the inspector general at the Justice Department voicing their concern that GEO was \"failing to provide adequate medical treatment\" at the Adelanto facility. Between December 2016 and the end of last July, three prisoners there died. Five others attempted suicide. \"It's very easy to get depressed there,\" Av\u00e9lica said. \"People give up.\"\n\nAv\u00e9lica's daughters drove out on the weekends. For the family, Brenda told me, his arrest \"was like a tornado hit us.\" Emotionally and financially, he had been the one holding the family together. At the end of each visit, she said, they would joke to their father and say, \"OK, let's go.\" Then the guards would lead him off, and close the door, and they would get in the car and drive home in silence. Diamante pushed on. Except for the attention it has received, he told me, there was nothing unusual about Av\u00e9lica's situation. \"I see cases like this every day.\"\n\nIn June, a judge vacated the criminal convictions that had been the basis of Av\u00e9lica's deportation order. On August 6th, an immigration court threw out the deportation order too. Av\u00e9lica stayed on at Adelanto. Finally, on August 30th, an immigration judge agreed to release him on a $6,000 bond. Nine camera crews were waiting outside the prison parking lot. In the weeks that followed, Av\u00e9lica transformed into an activist, talking to community groups and lobbying politicians. \"The only way to fight injustice,\" he told me, \"is for the people to raise their voice.\" The last time I saw him, he was just back from speaking at a rally in Sacramento, and on his way to a meeting with the Mexican Consul. But on the day of his release, it was time for celebration. People had banded together, and this time, they had won. There was a party for Av\u00e9lica at the taco shop where he had worked, which his friends and family had decorated with banners and balloons. His first stop in L.A., though, was at the Mission San Conrado, just north of downtown, to give thanks for his freedom to God, to Saint Jude \u2013 the patron saint of the impossible, the desperate and the hopeless \u2013 and to the Virgin of Guadalupe, who looks over the Americas, regardless of borders.\n\nStefan Ruiz\n\nOutside the Law\n\nGuadalupe Barrientos is not her real name. Her story is long and tangled and she tells it with urgency, jumping easily from laughter to tears to laughter again. She laughs so often and with so much warmth that you might not guess how much trauma and loss she has squeezed into the 51 years she has spent on this planet. Barrientos was raised in El Salvador, and was a teenager when civil war broke out. She crossed the border to Guatemala and at 18 married the man who would become the father of her four children. He drove a minibus, drank too much and beat her brutally and often. He once fractured her skull with the butt of a pistol, she said. She needed 24 stitches in her scalp. In 2004, fearing for her life, she fled. A friend paid a coyote to bring her to California. The journey took two weeks, by truck, by car, by foot. Her plan was simple: to work and bring her children over so that they could live together as a family, without fear.\n\nBarrientos found a job as a housekeeper for a family in Hancock Park, the oldest of L.A.'s wealthy neighborhoods. She was what we would call a \"live-in,\" though the Spanish word she used translates more accurately as \"locked in.\" She would arrive on Monday morning and work into the night until Saturday: cleaning, cooking, babysitting and helping another worker, a Filipina, look after the family's elderly mother. She slept on a mattress on the floor of the children's room. For this she was paid, she said, $300 a week. On her days off she worked as a dishwasher and as a helper at a taqueria. She stayed for three years. Later she found work selling food \u2013 hot dogs, quesadillas, pupusas \u2013 from a cart, at first at a car wash and more recently on a street corner in South Central. She handed over her profits to the man who owned the cart, who gave her $40 for each eight-hour day. In recent months, she said, police have been cracking down on unlicensed vendors. Fearing arrest, she quit.\n\nBringing her children over has also proven difficult. Her oldest son, now 32, made it as far as Boston, but was later deported. Her next youngest made the perilous journey through Mexico by freight train and crossed the border with a group of 30 other migrants. The smugglers they had paid to guide them imprisoned them for two weeks in a house in Phoenix in an attempt to extort ransoms from their families. Her son broke the windows and helped the others to escape, Barrientos said, but ICE soon picked them up. She showed me a photo of him wearing a blue prison uniform and a look of anxious expectation. He was at a private immigration prison in Eloy, Arizona, at the time, just before his deportation. Back in Guatemala, she said, he had been kidnapped twice by gang members. His father had refused to pay them protection money \u2013 bus drivers are a common target \u2013 so they abducted and tortured him to sway the old man. When her son heard they were coming for him a third time, and were planning to kill him, he swallowed a powerful pesticide. He called her first, and begged forgiveness. \"I don't want to do it,\" he told her, \"but I don't want them to kill me.\" She wept at the memory. He was 21 when he died. He left behind a little boy, a grandson who Barrientos supports but has never been able to meet.\n\nA third son made it. After being shot by gangsters and spending three days in a coma, he fled north at 17 as part of the wave of Central American children who arrived in the U.S. in 2014, escaping the violence that has ravaged the region. He was ultimately granted asylum, and now lives in Los Angeles with his girlfriend, who recently gave birth to a son. The Trump administration has since canceled the Obama-era program for granting refugee status to fleeing Central American minors, and last June, ICE began cracking down on undocumented parents suspected of paying smugglers to bring their children here.\n\n\"I wish people understood it's out of necessity that people come here. It's not because they want to.\"\n\nBarrientos has a daughter too, a 14-year-old who was an infant when Barrientos had to leave her behind. She worries over her constantly: Her daughter's age and gender make her particularly vulnerable to the violence that has overtaken Guatemala, and to the many dangers of the journey north. For now, Barrientos sends her all the money she can, and makes do with photos and phone calls. \"She's like me in miniature,\" she told me with pride, down to the birthmark on her cheek.\n\nIf she had known to apply and had been able to afford a lawyer, Barrientos would likely have been granted asylum when she arrived here 14 years ago. It is now almost certainly too late. Until last year, she was able to hold out some small degree of hope that with enough struggle, enough marches and organizing and pressure from below, Congress might pass an immigration-reform package that would eventually give her some relief, that would allow her to work with dignity at a decent wage, to visit her children, to sleep through the night without fearing that ICE officers might tear her from her home. Trump's election has slammed every door shut. Barrientos can see no exit to the fear and heartache to which our laws have condemned her. She does not believe that is a reason to give up.\n\nIn 2010, three days after her son's death and one day after his funeral, which she was not able to attend, Barrientos marched in a May Day rally for immigrant rights in downtown Los Angeles. She wept through the entire demonstration, she said, but it was important to her to be there, to be counted, to be heard. \"This country has to realize that without us, it's nothing,\" she told me. \"We're the ones who make the country move. We're the ones who give everything.\"\n\nThe Door Swings Shut Again\n\nThree weeks after Diego Ortiz became a U.S. citizen, the Trump administration rescinded the Temporary Protected Status that previous administrations had extended to more than 5,000 Nicaraguans. Two weeks after that, the Department of Homeland Security announced that 59,000 Haitians with TPS had 18 months to leave the country. Ortiz was dismayed by the news. \"I wish people understood,\" he said, \"that it's out of necessity that people come here. It's not because they want to.\"\n\nBut the door that had opened for Ortiz and his family, that had allowed his parents to escape with their lives and raise their children without fear, was about to swing closed behind them: In January, Trump ended TPS for nearly 200,000 Salvadorans. And the administration continues its encroachment on immigrant protections: Earlier this month, in an escalation of the Justice Department's attack on sanctuary laws, Jeff Sessions filed a lawsuit against the state of California, to force state and local officials to cooperate with ICE. Sweeps like the one that tore R\u00f3mulo Av\u00e9lica from his family have become the new norm, especially in California: ICE arrested 212 people in five days of raids in and around Los Angeles in mid-February, 150 more in the Bay Area over one weekend in February, and another 115 over three days last week in San Diego. Wall or no wall, America is getting smaller, and the machine is getting uglier.\n\n\n\nBut that is not the only change. In the long run, and perhaps well before that, Trump's reign of fear may produce some unplanned results. Many of the new citizens I interviewed at naturalization ceremonies talked about the sense of helplessness they experienced in November 2016, of not having a vote, or a voice in the only country they considered home. Next time, and the time after that, they promised, they would not let the opportunity slide by. In the meantime, Trump's actions have already taught Patrick de la Cruz and the children of R\u00f3mulo Av\u00e9lica, and their classmates, and many thousands of other immigrant youth, with papers and without, that the only way to live in this country with dignity is to stand up, to organize, and to fight.", "title": "L.A.

Meanwhile, the home next door burns to the basement.\n\nTeam Mueller\u2019s never-ending hunt for reds in October 2016 has found zero evidence of Russian collusion among Team Trump. In contrast, Russian collusion among Democrats has been as hard to miss as a California wildfire. And yet they still miss it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeam Mueller did find Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2014 and how! The February 16 announcement of federal criminal indictments against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies was a Cold War flashback. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told journalists that Russians close to the Kremlin infiltrated the last presidential campaign \u201cto promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy.\u201d\n\nBut Rosenstein threw a bucket of wet sand onto the Left\u2019s simmering narrative that DJT = KGB. The Russian meddling began in 2014, well before Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign commenced. The Russians promoted Vermont senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s Democratic-primary bid and Green-party nominee Jill Stein\u2019s general-election effort. After Trump won, the Russians organized pro-Trump and anti-Trump demonstrations, once in New York City on the same day. They also staged an anti-Trump rally in Charlotte.\n\nFurthermore, Rosenstein said, \u201cThere is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in the alleged unlawful activity.\u201d Thus far, anyone on Team Trump who might have worked with Russians did so after being hoodwinked, not due to treason \u2014 as Democrats have shouted for more than a year.\n\nAlso, none of this should comfort Hillary Clinton. Rosenstein said: \u201cThere is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.\u201d So, rather than blame Russia for her epic fail, Hillary finally should concede that she lost a mismanaged campaign that barely visited Michigan and avoided Wisconsin as if it had been quarantined.\n\nThroughout these events, the president of the United States was not Donald Trump. It was Barack Obama. He appears to have done little to nothing about this Russian penetration of America\u2019s contest for the White House, other than to tell Putin to \u201ccut it out\u201d at a September 2016 meeting in China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, as if to bury the illusory Russia\u2013Trump nexus even further, a February 7 U.S.-led coalition airstrike on pro-Assad \u201cmercenaries\u201d in eastern Syria killed \u201cseveral dozen\u201d Russians, Moscow admitted. Sending Russians home in boxes is hardly what one would expect from Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cpuppet\u201d in Washington, no matter how much Joy Behar and Rachel Maddow huff and puff to the contrary.\n\nIn short, there is not enough proof of Russian collusion by Trump to fuel a stovetop pilot light.\n\nIn contrast, the evidence of Democratic collusion with Russia blazes on, even as Team Mueller ignores it.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s Russian Reset began in Geneva on March 6, 2009. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton huddled with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, and together they pressed a red button that should have been labeled \u201cReset\u201d in Russian. Instead, Hillary\u2019s aides had mislabeled it with the Russian word for \u201cOverload.\u201d Regardless, once pushed, the button symbolized a red dawn of increasingly cozy U.S.\u2013Russian affairs.\n\nObama announced on September 17, 2009, that he would cancel President George W. Bush\u2019s plan to station missile-defense systems in Poland and the Czech Republic. \u201cThis is a U-turn in U.S. policy,\u201d complained former Czech ambassador to Washington Alexander Vondra. \u201cRussia had furiously opposed the project, claiming it targeted Moscow\u2019s nuclear arsenal,\u201d added Luke Harding and Ian Traynor of London\u2019s Guardian. \u201cObama\u2019s climb-down is likely to be seen by Russia as a victory.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Vladimir Putin applauded Obama\u2019s strategic abandonment of the Poles and Czechs. The Russian strongman said: \u201cI do anticipate that this correct and brave decision will be followed by others.\u201d\n\nPutin soon savored more first-class service on the Russian Collusion Express. Barely a month after shafting Poland and the Czech Republic, Team Obama began to ply Putin with planes. To that end, Hillary jetted to Moscow on October 13, 2009.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted that a new Russian airline, Rosavia, is actively considering the acquisition of Boeing aircraft,\u201d Clinton declared at Moscow\u2019s Boeing Design Center. \u201cThe Ex-Im Bank would welcome an application for financing from Rosavia to support its purchase of Boeing aircraft.\u201d Three days later, the Washington Post reports, \u201cBoeing formally submitted its bid for the Russian deal.\u201d\n\nOn June 1, 2010, the Kremlin-owned Rostekhnologii company \u2014 now Rostec \u2014 decided to purchase up to 50 Boeing 737s for Russia\u2019s national airline, Aeroflot. Price: $3.7 billion.\n\nThat August 17, just ten weeks later, Boeing unveiled a $900,000 gift to the Clinton Foundation to \u201chelp support the reconstruction of Haiti\u2019s public education system\u201d after an earthquake had pulverized that destitute island the previous January.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHillary also promoted Skolkovo, an \u201cinnovation city\u201d near Moscow, backed by Kremlin seed rubles worth some $5 billion.\n\n\u201cAt a long meeting I had with [Russia\u2019s then-president Dimitry] Medvedev outside Moscow in October 2009, he raised his plan to build a high-tech corridor in Russia modeled after our own Silicon Valley,\u201d Hillary explained. \u201cI suggested that he visit the original in California,\u201d she added.\n\nHillary\u2019s State Department arranged for 22 leading U.S. venture capitalists to tour Skolkovo in May 2010. Medvedev, in turn, traversed Silicon Valley the next month.\n\nState persuaded Cisco, Google, and Intel, among others, to join Skolkovo. By 2012, the project boasted 28 \u201cKey Partners\u201d in America, Europe, and Russia. Three-fifths of these organizations donated to the Clinton Foundation or paid Bill Clinton speaking fees. From Russia with Money, an August 2016 paper by the Government Accountability Institute, reported that 17 \u201cKey Partners\u201d contributed between $6.5 million and $23.5 million to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nBut by 2013, the U.S. Army Foreign Military Studies Program warned: \u201cSkolkovo is arguably an overt alternative to clandestine industrial espionage.\u201d Boston-based FBI agent Lucia Ziobro concluded in 2014, \u201cThe FBI believes the true motives of the Russian partners, who are often funded by their government, is to gain access to classified, sensitive, and emerging technology from the companies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile visiting Moscow on March 24, 2010, Hillary justified these actions: \u201cOur goal is to help strengthen Russia.\u201d\n\nShe said this to First Channel TV host Vladimir Pozner, a Soviet-era relic who still communicates in barely accented English \u2014 just as he did when he tried to sell Western audiences on the joys of Communism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosatom, the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation, announced plans on June 8, 2010, to buy a 51.4 percent stake in Uranium One \u2014 a Canadian company whose international assets included some 20 percent of America\u2019s reserves of the active ingredient in atomic reactors and nuclear weapons. This $1.3 billion purchase of a strategic-commodity company required the approval of the mysterious Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Hillary was one of nine federal-agency chiefs on CFIUS (pronounced SIPH-ee-us).\n\nThree weeks later, Bill Clinton keynoted a Moscow conference staged by a Kremlin-tied investment bank that promoted Uranium One\u2019s acquisition. Renaissance Capital paid Clinton $500,000 for his one-hour speech that June 29.\n\nCFIUS\u2019s evaluation of Rosatom\u2019s offer, Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer observed, coincided with \u201ca spontaneous outbreak of philanthropy among eight shareholders in Uranium One.\u201d Then-chairman Ian Telfer gave the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative $3.1 million. Founder Frank Giustra gave the Clinton Foundation $131.3 million. Before, during, and after CFIUS\u2019s review, Schweizer calculates, \u201cshareholders involved in this transaction had transferred approximately $145 million to the Clinton Foundation or its initiatives.\u201d\n\nLeading congressional Republicans rebelled.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this potential takeover of U.S. nuclear resources by a Russian government\u2013owned agency would pose great potential harm to the national security of the United States,\u201d Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, then the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote CFIUS\u2019s then-chairman, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. The top Republicans on the Financial Services, Homeland Security, and Armed Services Committees also signed Ros-Lehtinen\u2019s October 5, 2010, letter, which beseeched CFIUS to \u201cblock the sale.\u201d\n\nAs a CFIUS member, the ever-voluble Hillary could have heeded this red alert and stopped Putin from controlling a fifth of U.S. uranium supplies.\n\nNo such luck.\n\nEighteen days after the GOP\u2019s admonition, CFIUS let Rosatom purchase a majority stake in Uranium One. Subsequent investments pushed the Kremlin\u2019s share of Uranium One to 100 percent by January 2013.\n\nSoon after taking total control of Uranium One, Rosatom CEO Sergei Kiriyenko crowed: \u201cFew could have imagined in the past that we would own 20 percent of U.S. reserves.\u201d\n\nObama clearly signaled the Kremlin that the Russian collusion would continue in his second term. At a March 26, 2012, meeting in Seoul, South Korea, an open microphone captured his conversation with Medvedev, which neither knew was being recorded.\n\nObama asked for Russia\u2019s patience, \u201cparticularly with missile defense.\u201d Obama added: \u201cThis is my last election. . . . After my election, I have more flexibility.\u201d\n\nMedvedev replied: \u201cI will transmit this information to Vladimir.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama got Moscow to rescue him from his Syrian \u201cred line\u201d fiasco.\n\nObama boasted in August 2012 that \u201ca red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized.\u201d\n\nOn August 21, 2013, Syrian dictator Bashar Assad struck rebel-controlled Ghouta with sarin nerve gas, killing hundreds of civilians, including boys and girls. The whole world was watching as Obama did nothing, even after Assad clearly poisoned his way across that red line.\n\nThen\u2013secretary of state John Kerry generated titters that September 8 when he said that America might ruffle Assad with \u201cunbelievably small\u201d air strikes. Kerry also said that day in London that Assad should surrender his chemical weapons and \u201callow a full and total accounting for that.\u201d\n\nMoscow loved the concept.\n\n\u201cWithin an hour, an hour and a half,\u201d Kerry said, \u201cI got a phone call from Sergei Lavrov of Russia suggesting that was a really good idea.\u201d\n\nBy mid-September, the U.S. and Russia agreed that Assad would remain untouched, and Syria would sign the Chemical Weapons Convention and yield its toxins.\n\nWhile doves defended this display of diplomacy and disarmament over resolve and force, this policy certainly increased Russia\u2019s global prestige and regional influence. But ultimately this agreement proved hollow when Assad yet again unleashed chemical weapons on his people last April, killing some 100 civilians. In response, President Trump finally enforced Obama\u2019s red line by raining 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles on Shayrat airfield, whence Assad had perpetrated that chemical assault.\n\nRepublican senators Charles Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina drafted a January 4 criminal referral against former British spy Christopher Steele.\n\n\u201cAccording to the law firm Perkins Coie,\u201d Grassley and Graham wrote, in June 2016, \u201cMr. Steele\u2019s dossier-related efforts were funded through Fusion GPS by that law firm on behalf of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton Campaign.\u201d Steele\u2019s work scored him $160,000.\n\nGrassley and Graham note: \u201cOn the face of the dossier, it appears that Mr. Steele gathered much of his information from Russian government sources inside Russia.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The contents of this \u201csalacious and unproven\u201d dossier (in former FBI chief James Comey\u2019s words) wound up triggering a questionable wiretap on former Trump adviser Carter Page and filling newspapers and broadcasts with anti-Trump propaganda.\n\nSo, the relentless, fruitless quest for Russian collusion among Team Trump instead finds it alive and well among Team Clinton \u2014 and as tough to detect as a May Day march through Red Square.\n\nIf Special Counsel Robert Mueller sincerely wishes to expose Russian collusion in general, rather than search in vain for the Republican strain of this virus, he should scrutinize the other side of the aisle. Democrats colluded with Russia from 2009 to at least 2016. If Mueller has no idea where to look, he might start by connecting the nine dots that appear above.", "title": "Russian Collusion: Democrats, Obama, Hillary Clinton"}, {"url": "https://bearingdrift.com/2018/03/22/nuclear-fortress/", "content": "Nuclear Fortress\n\nHow safe are Virginia\u2019s nuclear power plants from terrorists, hackers, and natural disasters? Let\u2019s put it this way: Dominion worries about such threats 24/7 so you don\u2019t have to.\n\nIn addition to interfering in U.S. elections, Vladimir Putin\u2019s busy cyber-servants have been probing information technology weaknesses in U.S. industry and infrastructure. Sophisticated cyber-attacks have been ongoing since at least March 2016. Perhaps most alarming, the Department of Homeland Security asserted last week, Russian hackers gained access to critical control systems at unidentified nuclear power plants.\n\n\u201cWe now have evidence they\u2019re sitting on the machines, connected to industrial control infrastructure, that allow them to effectively turn the power off or effect sabotage, the New York Times quoted Eric Chien, a security technology director at digital-security firm Symantec, as saying. \u201cThey have the ability to shut the power off. All that\u2019s missing is some missing political motivation.\u201d\n\nJournalist Ted Koppel highlighted the vulnerability of the U.S. electric grid to attack in his 2016 book, \u201cLights Out: Cyberattack, a Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath.\u201d Novelists have imagined the horrifying societal collapse following the collapse of the electric grid. As for nuclear plants, the potential for radioactive contamination makes the threat even more terrifying. Fear-inducing scenarios involve terrorist takeovers, the theft of spent radioactive fuel, and jetliners slamming 9/11 style into nuclear reactors.\n\nThe issue of security was top of mind for me when I toured Dominion Energy Virginia\u2019s North Anna Power Station last month. I had the opportunity to pose the kind of questions that members of the public might ask.\n\nI\u2019m not qualified to render judgment on the effectiveness of Dominion\u2019s security efforts, but I can say one thing: Security at the nuclear facility is something the company thinks about around the clock. Utility officials have spent enormous time and effort anticipating and preparing for any scenario you can imagine. Earthquake? Check. Hurricane? Check. Cyber-attack? Check. Armed terrorist attack? Check. Hijacked airplane flying into the nuclear containment dome? Check.\n\nBased on what I learned, I\u2019m not worried about natural disasters or terrorist attacks. The threat of cyber-sabotage continues to unsettle me, but the danger is to the transmission and distribution grid, not to nuclear power plants. Dominion officials assured me \u2014 and for a simple reason that I shall explain in due course, I believe them \u2014 that their nuclear power plant controls are not vulnerable to a cyber-threat.\n\nIf there had never been a Chernobyl or Fukushima, I might not even be asking these questions. As it is, those calamities did occur. We learned that, as thorough as they try to be, nuclear engineers don\u2019t foresee every conceivable contingency. With nation states from Russia and China to Iran and North Korea seeking to penetrate and compromise our infrastructure, we need to keep up our guard. At the same time, we should avoid creating unnecessary alarm. So far, I\u2019ve seen nothing that makes me lose any sleep.\n\nEarthquakes, hurricanes, and aircraft strikes\n\nOn August 23 at 1:51:04 p.m., the control room of the North Anna Power Station began to shake, as if it were sitting on a giant vibrating phone, recalls Lee Baron, who worked in the control room then and now runs the company\u2019s simulation center. Lights on the control board began blinking. Alarms emitted shrill beeping noises. Tiles fell from the ceiling. Outside the facility, some electric transformers cracked.\n\nThe earthquake, the worst trembler to shake the East Coast in at least a century, exceeded what the power station had been designed for, says Baron, but the facility \u201cshrugged it off.\u201d Following Electric Power Research Institute guidelines, the operators powered down the plant without incident. After minor repairs and two months of intensive inspections, the nuclear station was up and running again.\n\nMedia attention focused on the fact that the North Anna station was located on an ancient geologic fault line. The fact that the epicenter of the earthquake was just a few miles away under the town of Mineral led many to conflate the two. But, the two fault lines were unrelated, says Richard Zuercher, manager-nuclear fleet communications for Dominion.\n\nIndeed, as College of William & Mary geologist Chuck Bailey concluded in a 2012 review of maps, photos, and reports, the fault underlying the North Anna Power Station had last been active about 200 million years ago. On the other hand, as the Mineral earthquake demonstrated, the geologic plate upon which the East Coast rests was more active than previously supposed.\n\nUnlike some earthquakes that have a highly localized impact that creates heavy damage, Zuercher says, the Mineral shaker, which registered 5.8 on the Richter scale, diffused its energy and caused light damage over a vast area. The quake was felt as far away as Atlanta and New Brunswick. Virginia does not face a California-like threat of a massive killer quake.\n\nHurricanes and tornadoes are another theoretical threat. The concern is that wind might pick up a cars or telephone poles and hurl them like projectiles. The nuclear reactors, a third of which are underground, are protected by massive containment domes made of compressed concrete lined by steel plate and reinforced by steel rebar.\n\nThe 4 1/2-feet-thick dome wall \u201cis built to take a licking,\u201d says B.E. Standley, the Dominion executive in charge of nuclear power plant safety. \u201cIt can survive anything short of an asteroid strike or zombie apocalypse.\u201d Continue reading ?\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nGoogle\n\nPinterest\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nRelated", "title": "Nuclear Fortress"}, {"url": "https://bigislandnow.com/2018/02/23/hawaii-volcano-watch-slow-slip-event-on-kilauea-volcanos-south-flank-expected-this-year/", "content": "Today\u2019s Volcano Watch begins with a question: Can you guess when the next slow slip event will happen on K\u012blauea Volcano\u2019s South Flank?

These instruments show that the south flank moves steadily seaward about 2.3 inches every year, which is attributed to a phenomenon called \u201cfault creep.\u201d\n\nDuring a slow earthquake, the south flank surges seaward by an additional amount, usually about 1.2 inches. This additional motion occurs over two to three days, and is about the same amount that would happen in a regular magnitude-6 earthquake.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nK\u012blauea slow slip events tend to occur evenly in time; in particular, events after 2005 have occurred every 2.5 years, give or take three months.

On the East Rift Zone, the 61g lava flow remained active downslope of Puu Oo, with scattered breakouts on the pali and coastal plain, but no ocean entry. The 61g flows do not pose an immediate threat to nearby communities.\n\nMauna Loa Volcano is not erupting. A few small-magnitude earthquakes occurred beneath the volcano, primarily on its west flank, at depths ranging from 3-8 miles. Two small earthquakes also occurred near Mauna Loa\u2019s summit at depths less than 3 miles. GPS and InSAR measurements continue to show slow deformation related to inflation of a magma reservoir beneath the summit and upper Southwest Rift Zone.

It hit Lee Merschon on Oct. 10, two days after the North Bay fires began to spread.\n\nMerschon runs an event-planning company in Los Angeles. Sitting at home there, watching reports about the fires on TV, he didn\u2019t understand how bad they were. Then he started getting phone calls from friends in Northern California who camp with him at Burning Man, the annual counterculture gathering in the Nevada desert.\n\n\u201cLee, this is it,\u201d said Jeff Evans, whose home in Napa County was nearly destroyed in a fire years earlier. \u201cThis is what the containers are for.\u201d\n\nThe containers. Every August at Burning Man, 70,000 people convene on a sun-blasted patch of Nevada desert and build a temporary city. Merschon\u2019s piece of Burning Man is Camp Epic, a campsite he founded in 2012. While many Burners eat and sleep in RVs, the 150 inhabitants of Camp Epic live in six heavily modified metal shipping containers. Each is basically a small house: a rectangular prism 40 feet long, like a giant Tetris block, built by a Nevada company called Quick Space that manufactures storage trailers and mobile offices.\n\nThe containers hold up better than RVs in the harsh glare and wind of Burning Man, Merschon says. They have electrical systems, ventilation, beds, shelves, mini-fridges. They don\u2019t have windows, on purpose. \u201cAt Burning Man, you can have 50 mph winds in a sandstorm that looks like \u2018Mad Max,\u2019\u201d he says. But inside a container, \u201cIt seems like everything is normal.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why, even before the wildfires, he\u2019d wondered whether the containers could be called into service in a disaster zone, providing a basic place to live after a hurricane or earthquake.\n\nThen the October wildfires struck, and thousands of homes went up in flames.\n\nThis is what the containers are for.\n\nThe plan formed quickly in Merschon\u2019s mind: People need housing. We have these containers. They\u2019re sitting in storage in Reno. Let\u2019s send them to people who need housing. Let\u2019s send them to the city of Santa Rosa, the center of devastation.\n\nIt felt like a sensible, responsible thing to do. The containers were metal. They couldn\u2019t catch fire like wooden structures. And Quick Space had built them to comply with Nevada\u2019s residential housing code. What could be simpler?\n\n\u201cAt least, that\u2019s what we thought,\u201d Merschon says.\n\nOver the next four months, though, he and dozens of volunteers got a crash course in why it can be so hard to erect housing in California. Santa Rosa officials say that the group had unrealistic expectations. The volunteers say they were obstructed by delays and red tape.\n\n\u201cWe kind of went down a rabbit hole,\u201d says Carmen Mauk, one of the group\u2019s leaders. They couldn\u2019t simply give their gift, they discovered; they had to wait, and wait, and then alter it at great cost, and then wait some more.\n\nThe Burners moved fast. The same day he spoke to Jeff Evans in Napa, Merschon called another camper, Jen Martini, who lived in Santa Rosa. Her mother had lost her house, almost all of her belongings and the family cat in the Tubbs Fire. Martini said she\u2019d go to Reno and prepare the cubes for transport.\n\nMerschon also contacted Mauk, who would become the heart and soul of the project. Mauk, 47, is a former resident of Santa Rosa. The Tubbs Fire had turned the house she used to rent into rubble and ash.\n\nMauk has more than a decade of experience in disaster relief. She got started in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina, when she traveled to the Gulf Coast of Mississippi with about 100 other Burner volunteers. They beat federal relief workers there, and began doing debris removal, tearing down damaged houses. They thought of the work as a gift; at Burning Man, a cashless society, the entire economy runs on gifts.\n\nPhoto: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle The painted 53-foot trailer at Oasis Village, a proposed and...\n\nMauk then founded a nonprofit, Burners Without Borders. Its volunteers went to Peru after an earthquake and built school classrooms and composting toilets. They went to Haiti after its 2010 earthquake. They went to New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.\n\nNow, Mauk was going back to Santa Rosa.\n\nShe knew that people had been struggling to find housing there even before the fires \u2014 only 1 percent of the city\u2019s rental stock was vacant \u2014 and when she heard that almost 9,000 homes and other buildings had been destroyed, she wondered about the fate of working-class people who keep its economy humming: teachers, vineyard laborers, construction workers. How could the region recover if its workers couldn\u2019t find shelter?\n\nMauk and other Burners contacted affordable housing groups. All said that the situation was desperate. They had lists of clients begging for any kind of housing.\n\n\u201cThere were no housing options before,\u201d says Lorena Sotelo, who assists Sonoma County farm workers at California Human Development, a large nonprofit. \u201cNow it\u2019s even worse.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency had yet to arrive. Its first temporary trailers wouldn\u2019t be habitable until Nov. 13, and many in need of shelter would avoid them anyway, fearing deportation, say Sotelo and others who work with undocumented clients. (FEMA has reported low demand; as of January, only 189 of 3,200 people eligible to live in the trailers had asked to do so.)\n\nAcross the region, in parking lots and along the beaches, people were sleeping in cars, in the cold, with no bathrooms, no security. At the Free Store in Healdsburg, a kind of emergency supply depot for shell-shocked families, Ariel Kelley met a family with two young sons sleeping in the back of their truck. When she heard about the shipping-container project, Kelley was excited. Dubbed Oasis Village, it seemed like the fastest way possible to get at least some people into beds.\n\nThe project\u2019s goal was a modest one: provide 76 beds for 76 people for up to nine months. If it worked, it would help 76 people stay in the area who might otherwise have to leave.\n\nMauk and the Burners put out a call for funds and volunteers; 250 people offered manual labor, and $30,000 in donations flowed in. A businessman who owned a cannabis greenhouse in an industrial part of Santa Rosa offered a piece of land. The six shipping containers arrived on Oct. 26, along with a 53-foot trailer that Merschon and his campers had also adapted into a living space. The structures were arranged in a rectangle around a 100-by-50-foot courtyard.\n\nPhoto: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle Oasis Village, in an industrial area of Santa Rosa, never housed...\n\nOn Oct. 31, the Burners applied for a temporary use permit from the city of Santa Rosa. While waiting to hear back, a rotating crew of volunteers spruced up Oasis Village. They put new bedding on the twin and queen beds inside the containers, and added heaters.\n\nThey also set up one of the containers as a kitchen, with donated cookware, and brought in separate trailers with showers and bathrooms. To make the site feel more welcoming, they covered the dirt courtyard with compacted gravel and artificial turf, and erected a semipermanent, heated tent above it, to serve as a communal area.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t luxury living. Still, nonprofit agencies had clients who wanted to move in. The Free Store\u2019s Kelley also heads Corazon Healdsburg, a nonprofit that works to find families affordable housing. Fifteen families told her they were interested; it beat sleeping in their cars.\n\nFrom the Burners\u2019 point of view, Oasis Village was now ready. They weren\u2019t just proposing to build housing; they had built it. Seventy-six temporary units, complete and available. All it needed was the city\u2019s blessing, and people could begin moving in.\n\n\u201cWe here \u2014 any local jurisdiction \u2014 has one set of rules,\u201d says Jesse Oswald, permit intake manager for the Santa Rosa Planning and Economic Development Department. \u201cCalifornia Building Code, Title 24. This is how we build things.\u201d\n\nOswald had no objections to the concept of Oasis Village, he says. He thought it was a creative solution, \u201ca cool project.\u201d But it was his job to make sure Oasis Village met the state building code before he signed any permits. He and his staff had to abide by the code, which is there to ensure the health and safety of residents. And it doesn\u2019t distinguish between emergency temporary housing and any other type. Oasis Village, a cluster of shipping containers, would have to go through the same permit process as a new single-family home in Santa Rosa\u2019s Coffey Park neighborhood, which was destroyed during the fires.\n\nThe Burners didn\u2019t realize this until they started talking to city planners. According to all involved, these were friendly conversations. But the Burners soon found them frustrating. The planners appeared overwhelmed; it often took weeks to get answers to questions. When the answers came, they weren\u2019t what the Burners wanted to hear.\n\nTo obtain permits, the Burners would need to show that the containers met California residential code \u2014 a daunting challenge. The retrofittted containers had been built to Nevada residential code by a company that wasn\u2019t on California\u2019s list of approved providers. From Santa Rosa\u2019s perspective, the containers were black boxes, full of potential liability. Was the wiring safe? Was there unhealthy Chinese drywall on the inside? (There wasn\u2019t.)\n\n\u201cI have no way of knowing how it was even assembled,\u201d says Oswald. \u201cIf I sign on the dotted line, I have to say I\u2019m really comfortable with 70 people living in these things.\u201d\n\nMerschon saw things differently: \u201cEverybody was covering their butts because they didn\u2019t want to get sued later.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle Painted shipping containers at Oasis Village.\n\nIt dawned on the Burners that the city wouldn\u2019t sign off unless expensive alterations were made. The site, they were told, needed access for disabled people. An ADA-compliant shower would cost at least $4,000.\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019re going to have ADA compliance,\u201d Mauk said, \u201cbut not on the first frickin\u2019 day we open. \u2026 Hello, there\u2019s an emergency housing situation here!\u201d\n\nThen there was the issue of windows. The containers didn\u2019t have any. To meet the code, windows would have to be cut into the containers\u2019 doors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s $250 a door,\u201d Mauk says. \u201cThere\u2019s 15 doors. Everything becomes very expensive very quickly.\u201d\n\nOne day, chatting with one of the planners, Mauk started to get \u201ca little riled up\u201d over the windows. Why delay the project for the sake of windows, she asked, when people were out there sleeping in their cars?\n\nAccording to Mauk, the reply came: \u201cWell, cars have windows.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe saw the ridiculousness in it, too,\u201d Mauk says, looking back. \u201cHe was trying to help me understand.\u201d Yes, cars have windows, and they\u2019re built to a standard, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re allowed to come into California.\n\nBy that point, Merschon was done. Done with the city, done with the whole project. When friends asked about it, he changed the subject. He wondered, darkly, if Santa Rosa was putting up roadblocks to Oasis Village because it didn\u2019t care if poor people left the city.\n\nMauk felt differently. She thought the planners wanted the project to happen, but didn\u2019t have the power. \u201cWe were met warmly from the beginning,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that their hands are really tied, having to follow state laws.\u201d\n\nShe sent a letter to Gov. Jerry Brown and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, asking the state to make an emergency declaration \u201cthat will allow for expedited temporary housing.\u201d She received no response from either office.\n\n\u201cThe system is not working,\u201d Mauk says. \u201cNobody is listening.\u201d\n\nOthers were also frustrated. Adrian Chorley, the affordable housing director at California Human Development, visited Oasis Village in December. He was impressed, he says. \u201cAnd the thing is that Carmen has done this before. She has actually set up a project in Haiti \u2014 with none of the problems we had here.\u201d\n\nHe thought Oasis Village looked like an RV park. Maybe not a place for families with young children, but a \u201cperfectly acceptable\u201d place for single adults, perhaps, or for the construction workers pouring into Santa Rosa to rebuild people\u2019s homes but with no place to live themselves.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t believe that the city wouldn\u2019t sign off on the needed permits. \u201cI quite literally stood there and said, \u2018What, are you kidding? They\u2019ve provided housing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs January began, the Burners were out of money, and enthusiasm. They had spent $30,000 to merely transport the containers from Reno and prepare the site. Actually running the project would require another $80,000. They applied for a grant from a fire relief fund administered by the Redwood Credit Union, but the grant was turned down. The credit union said the problem was the project\u2019s lack of permits. Mauk says that in conversations with Redwood, permits were never discussed.\n\nThe Burners guessed that if they tried to find other funding, they might be able to house people by March, at best. The containers had to go back to Nevada by August. Too much time had been lost.\n\nSo, on a warm and sunny Saturday in early February, Oasis Village came down. Mauk and a dozen volunteers stripped the beds, gathered up the kitchenware, and donated the sheets and pots and pans to charity.\n\nIn the months since the fires, the housing crisis in Sonoma County has worsened. One of the largest contractors planning to rebuild homes in Coffey Park, DeNova, announced in January that it was pulling out, saying it was unable to find enough workers. Officials say that 30,000 housing units must be built in the next five years to meet demand.\n\nChorley says that\u2019s unrealistic. \u201cWe\u2019ll be lucky, quite honestly, if we can build 2,000 to 3,000 units in the next five years.\u201d\n\nKelley says it\u2019s \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d that the Burners never got to house people, and thinks government should have been more flexible. \u201cWhen you\u2019re faced with this kind of a disaster, you hope that people are able to think outside the box,\u201d she says. \u201cHealth and safety have to be paramount, but at the same time, there are creative solutions to every problem. You just need to have willing participants who recognize the urgency.\u201d\n\nNonprofit groups say they are hearing from some clients that they can\u2019t make it here. They\u2019re leaving the region. \u201cThey\u2019re going to Texas, Arizona, Las Vegas,\u201d Sotelo says. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything. You know how you feel when you know the need is there and you can\u2019t do anything? I don\u2019t know what to say anymore.\u201d\n\nThe Burners have left, too. They\u2019ll never do another project in California, they say.\n\n\u201cWe showed up,\u201d Merschon says. \u201cWe built a town. It was ready in two weeks. We said, here you go. And they wouldn\u2019t take it. We give them a gift \u2014 how could they not take it?\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m reminded,\u201d he says, \u201cthat the real world doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d", "title": "In wake of Wine Country fires, a burning desire to help goes up in smoke"}, {"url": "http://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2018/03/15/Pedestrian-bridge-collapses-at-university-injuries-unclear/stories/201803150153", "content": "Already have an account?\n\nLogin", "title": "Death toll rises to 6 in collapse of Miami bridge that was built with \u2018innovative\u2019 system"}, {"url": "http://www.vnews.com/Beard-Foundation-names-Jose-Andres-Humanitarian-of-the-Year-following-a-turbulent-year-for-chefs-15851526", "content": "The Washington Post\n\nF ollowing a turbulent year in which chefs from New York to Oakland, Calif., were accused of sexual harassment, the James Beard Foundation announced recently that it would bestow its annual Humanitarian of the Year award on a chef who exhibited far more selfless qualities during 2017: Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, the Washingtonian who led the charge to feed millions of people in Houston, Puerto Rico and Southern California after natural disasters struck those areas.\n\n\u201cJos\u00e9\u2019s work in Puerto Rico and Haiti shows how chefs can use their expertise and unique skills to enact profound change on a global scale,\u201d Mitchell Davis, the foundation\u2019s executive vice president, said in a statement.\n\nAndr\u00e9s will receive the award at the foundation\u2019s May 7 ceremony in Chicago. \u201cHe has demonstrated how, at the most difficult times, hot-cooked meals provide more than nutrition, they provide dignity. Jos\u00e9\u2019s work serves as an important reminder of how precious and nourishing food can be. And we couldn\u2019t imagine a more fitting honoree this year as we celebrate how chefs and our industry \u2018Rise.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe foundation\u2019s \u201cRise\u201d campaign \u2014 which \u201ccelebrates the community of chefs and industry leaders who rise to the occasion\u201d \u2014 is part of its efforts at damage control in an industry that has been rocked by scandals. Among those charged with sexual harassment last year are New Orleans chef and restaurateur John Besh and New York chef and restaurateur Mario Batali, both James Beard Award winners.\n\nA Beard winner himself, Andr\u00e9s rose to the occasion last year with his humanitarian efforts, which often put him at odds with President Donald Trump, who was accused of focusing his attention on other matters as the crisis unfolded in Puerto Rico. (Andr\u00e9s and Trump have, of course, been legal foes, too, after the chef backed out of his lease at the Trump International Hotel in the summer of 2015 when the then-presidential candidate labeled Mexicans as drug dealers and rapists on the campaign trail.)\n\nDuring the latter part of 2017, Andr\u00e9s, the chef and owner behind ThinkFoodGroup, frequently took leave of his daily responsibilities to focus on feeding the hungry with World Central Kitchen, the nonprofit he founded after the massive earthquake in Haiti.\n\nThe chef and nonprofit first mobilized in Houston in late August after Hurricane Harvey turned much of the city into a giant lake. A month later, they were in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, providing millions of hot meals to residents who would have had to survive on MREs and snacks for months if not for Andr\u00e9s and countless volunteers.\n\nLate in 2017, Andr\u00e9s and World Central Kitchen also collaborated with L.A. Kitchen \u2014 founded by Robert Egger, the same man who started D.C. Central Kitchen, an organization that Andres has championed for years \u2014 to help feed displaced residents and firefighters who battled the wildfires in Southern California.\n\nWhen contacted by phone about the Humanitarian of the Year award, Andr\u00e9s, 48, quickly deflected attention away from himself. \u201cI\u2019ve been praised enough,\u201d the chef said. This is something of an understatement: Since focusing his attention on disaster relief, Andr\u00e9s and his work have been covered in depth by many media outlets, including The New York Times, 60 Minutes and The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cWe are all as good as the people around us,\u201d Andr\u00e9s added. \u201cIn my case ... I was in the right moment, in the right place and surrounded by the right people.\u201d\n\nWith women calling out sexual harassers in many industries \u2014 entertainment, politics, media and restaurants, to name a few \u2014 Andr\u00e9s noted that many have called 2017 the year of the woman. He was fast to acknowledge the influences in his own development, including chefs Susan McCreight Lindeborg and Nora Pouillon, who were pioneers in helping to feed the poor and hungry through an innovative Share Our Strength program in the 1990s.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Andr\u00e9s has been honored for his activism. In 2012, Time magazine listed Andr\u00e9s among the 100 Most Influential People in the World. The magazine specifically called out the chef\u2019s activism, including his work for D.C. Central Kitchen, the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves and First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s Let\u2019s Move! campaign. At the time, Andr\u00e9s acknowledged chef-activist Alice Waters as an inspiration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been inspired by so many people,\u201d Andr\u00e9s said last week. People continue to inspire him daily, he added.\n\nWorld Central Kitchen\u2019s work in Puerto Rico has, in fact, inspired Andr\u00e9s to rethink how the nonprofit goes about its business in disaster zones. To date, WCK has served 3.3 million meals in Puerto Rico, most of them prepared by volunteer chefs who work in makeshift kitchens, and the organization continues to have a presence on the island. Volunteers still make more than 6,000 meals a day for residents in areas that have yet to fully recover from the hurricane, Andr\u00e9s said.\n\nBut during a recent trip to the island, Andr\u00e9s and crew started developing new approaches to feed people after natural disasters. One idea includes shipping containers retrofitted into mobile kitchens, which could be moved from place to place within 24 to 48 hours. The nonprofit also wants to help Puerto Ricans grow more of their own food; Andr\u00e9s estimated that nearly 90 percent of the food on the island comes from somewhere else.\n\nThere was other good news for Andr\u00e9s last week. Anthony Bourdain Books/Ecco, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers, announced that it has acquired the North American rights to the story of how Andr\u00e9s, WCK and all those volunteers fed millions on Puerto Rico. The book, We Fed an Island: The True Story of Rebuilding Puerto Rico, One Meal at a Time, will be written by Andr\u00e9s. It\u2019s set for release in September via author and celebrity chef Bourdain\u2019s imprint.\n\n\u201cWith a fraction of the resources available to the government, huge non-profits or NGOs, Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s and World Central Kitchen fed hundreds of thousands of desperate people in Puerto Rico, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria,\u201d Bourdain noted in the announcement. \u201cTheir ingenuity, creativity and fortitude deserve to be recognized, and recorded and replicated as a practical blueprint for how humans can and should best react in the face of disaster. To say that I am proud to publish this book, and to help tell this vital story, is a vast understatement.\u201d\n\nAndr\u00e9s is not prepared to say that his life has taken a turn because of his humanitarian work in Puerto Rico and other disaster areas. He said he could never have predicted what kind of success he would achieve after immigrating to the United States in 1991. He\u2019s not about to predict what the future holds now.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what my life is going to be like in the next five to 10 years,\u201d he said.", "title": "In a Tough Year for Top Chefs, a Humanitarian Restores the Faith"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2018/03/05/daily-202-democratic-committees-divided-over-playing-in-primaries-with-texas-as-ground-zero/5a9c381430fb047655a06a9d/", "content": "Jim Mathis places a campaign sign near a polling site in San Antonio.

John Culberson (R). The campaign arm for House Democrats concluded that Moser could not win the general election in a suburban Houston district that Hillary Clinton narrowly carried. Among other things, she wrote a piece for Washingtonian magazine in 2014 that said she\u2019d \u201csooner have my teeth pulled out without anesthesia\u201d than move to her grandparents\u2019 home in rural Texas.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez does not think the DCCC should have publicized that information. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d he told me and USA Today\u2019s Susan Page in an interview that aired Sunday for C-SPAN\u2019s \u201cNewsmakers\u201d series. \u201cWe\u2019re at our best as Democrats when we talk about the issues. \u2026 I don\u2019t believe we should be anointing candidates.

The DNC, which Perez has now led for a year, is trying to restore trust that was lost in the national party during the contentious 2016 nominating contest between Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cOne thing we\u2019ve learned at the DNC is that when you, in fact or in perception, are trying to put the thumb on the scale in a spirited primary, that can undermine public confidence in us,\u201d said Perez. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve been neutral.\u201d\n\nLaura Moser picks up campaign materials at a print shop in Houston. (Michael Stravato for the Washington Post)\n\nA constellation of liberal groups \u2014 from Justice Democrats and CREDO to the Sanders-aligned Our Revolution \u2014 launched online petitions last week telling DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n to \u201cstop attacking progressives.\u201d\n\nThe DCCC anticipated this blowback. The veteran operatives who work there could have easily placed each of the \u201coppo hits\u201d on Moser in the press with no fingerprints attached. The fact they didn\u2019t was as significant as the underlying content of the message. They were sending a signal about their willingness to wade into crowded primaries and gauging the reaction from the left as they plot strategy for looming primary fights.\n\nThese operatives expect that it will be imperative to intervene in California, where a jungle primary system means that the top two finishers in June will face each other in November, regardless of their party. If there are bunches of Democrats splitting the vote, that could allow two Republicans to make it to the runoff.\n\n\u201cAs we've indicated all cycle, the DCCC is keeping all options on the table to work with our allies and ensure that there's a competitive Democrat on the ballot for voters to elect in November,\u201d Meredith Kelly, the DCCC\u2019s communications director, said on Sunday.\n\nRepublicans are hopeful that record numbers of Democratic primary candidates will lead to squabbling and push the eventual nominees to the left in places like Texas\u2019s Seventh District. The Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC backed by Speaker Paul Ryan, has been looking for opportunities to sow division. On Friday, the group published internal polling that showed Moser gaining since the DCCC\u2019s attacks.\n\nDNC Chairman Tom Perez participates in a Daily 202 Live event last year. (Kristoffer Tripplaar for The Washington Post)\n\nTalking with Democrats over the weekend about the appropriateness of wading into primaries sparked a sense of deja vu because I had almost identical conversations with strategists at the Republican committees and outside groups when they were out of the White House. Republicans blew a lot of winnable races during the Obama years because unelectable candidates prevailed in primaries, from Christine O\u2019Donnell and Sharron Angle in 2010 to Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock in 2012. Allies of Mitch McConnell became more aggressive in 2014, and it helped him become majority leader. On the other hand, going after tea partyers earned the enmity of the base \u2014 and helped lead to disenchantment with the party establishment that allowed for the rise of Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nJust like his Republican counterparts used to, Perez argued that heated primaries make his party stronger. He noted that Ralph Northam won the Virginia governor\u2019s race last November despite facing a credible primary challenge from former congressman Tom Perriello on his left.\n\n\u201cEverybody who went to the polls felt like they had a fair shake, and their candidate had a fair shake,\u201d said Perez. \u201cIt has increased turnout and it has really put wind at our back going into general elections. \u2026 We have to be careful not to confuse unity with unanimity.\u201d (Watch the full half-hour interview here.)\n\nBecause the DNC is staying on the sidelines, the DCCC is becoming a sort of boogeyman on the left. A black Democratic candidate in Pennsylvania last week even accused the committee of trying to nudge him out of the race in favor of white candidates, which the party denied. (Dave Weigel has more on that.)\n\nSigns point to an early voting location in San Antonio. (Eric Gay/AP)\n\n-- Against the backdrop of this intraparty wrangling, there is growing evidence of especially strong Democratic enthusiasm:\n\nFor example, a record number of candidates are running for Congress this year. Paul Kane pulled the numbers for his Sunday column: \u201cBy Dec. 31, 2017, more than 2,100 people had taken at least the first step toward running for the House or Senate by filing the necessary paperwork, according to records kept by the Federal Election Commission. For context, that\u2019s almost twice as many candidates who launched congressional campaigns in 2015. It represents the most candidates at this stage of the election season since the FEC started keeping these records, in 1977. \u2026\n\n\u201cBy Dec. 31, some 1,133 candidates had filed to run as Democrats for House seats, easily the largest crop either party has ever assembled at that point of an election cycle. Even Republicans, with 689 declared candidates for the House in 2017, have their second-largest field ever, trailing only 2009. That massive crop of 745 candidates, the second-largest ever for any party, set the stage for the 2010 midterm wave that delivered Republicans the House majority.\u201d\n\nIn Texas alone, there are 111 House candidates. For the first time in 25 years, at least one Democrat is running in all 36 of the state\u2019s congressional district. In 2016, the party didn\u2019t even field a challenger against eight GOP incumbents. \u201cOn a state legislative level, Democrats have candidates in 132 of the 150 state House districts and in 14 of the 15 state Senate districts up for election this year,\u201d NPR\u2019s Jessica Taylor notes. \u201cThat includes four Senate districts where Democrats didn't field candidates in 2014 or 2012, and 20 new House districts where they didn't have candidates in either 2016, 2014 or 2012.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks largely to a huge surge in Democratic turnout, Texans in the 15 largest counties have smashed the record for early voting in a non-presidential year,\u201d Jonathan Tilove reports in today\u2019s Austin American-Statesman. \u201cWhile there is no necessary correlation between primary and general election turnout, more than twice as many people voted early in the Democratic primaries in 2018 as in 2014, while Republican early voting crept up by 15 percent \u2026 Early voting this year in the Democratic contests was so high in Travis County [which includes Austin] that it slightly exceeded participation in 2016, a presidential year.\u201d\n\nRep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) deplanes from Air Force One with President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama in 2013. (Josh Reynolds/AP)\n\n-- The primary season that begins tomorrow will not wrap up until September, when Massachusetts, Delaware, New Hampshire, New York and Rhode Island vote. (See the full calendar here.)\n\nPurity tests could become a problem during the long stretch between now and then. A story on the front page of today\u2019s New York Times notes that even Rep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) is facing a serious primary challenge from his left in Boston. \u201cMr. Capuano, who is serving his 20th year in Congress, is a down-the-line progressive \u2026 But he has stirred a challenge from Ayanna Pressley, the first black woman elected to the Boston City Council,\u201d Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin report. \u201cIn a district once held by John F. Kennedy and Tip O\u2019Neill, where college campuses abound and minority communities now make up most of the population, Ms. Pressley argues that voters should demand an activist lawmaker who is more than a \u2018reliable vote.\u2019 In an unusual show of deference to Ms. Pressley, two of the state\u2019s highest-profile Democrats, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Seth Moulton, said they would stay neutral rather than back their colleague in Congress. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III \u2026 is behind Mr. Capuano.\u201d\n\nThe 66-year-old incumbent has voted twice to impeach Trump, but he could still lose anyway. \u201cMy district is upset,\u201d Capuano said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like the Donald Trump agenda, and I\u2019ve been as vocal as I can be.\u201d\n\nFolks attend a Republican congressional candidate forum in New Braunfels, Tex. (Eric Gay/AP)\n\n-- But while Democrats face pressure to lurch left, Republicans feel like they must wholeheartedly embrace Trump to win a GOP primary in this environment. Mike DeBonis and Eva Ruth Moravec report on the crowded GOP primaries in Texas: \u201cOne candidate\u2019s campaign signs declare \u2018MAGA,\u2019 referencing Trump\u2019s mantra of \u2018Make America Great Again.\u2019 Another\u2019s is promising to \u2018drain the swamp\u2019 and plays up his ties to a key Trump political adviser. And another\u2019s promises to \u2018Make America Like Texas,\u2019 a slogan spelled out in the Trump campaign\u2019s signature font. \u2026 With some notable exceptions, candidates in one especially raucous Republican primary \u2014 the 18-person contest to fill the 21st District seat being vacated by Rep. Lamar Smith \u2014 have been wary of showing any daylight between their position and Trump\u2019s. \u2018I think if you\u2019re not with the president, you\u2019re not going to have a chance of winning this race,\u2019 said Jason Isaac, a state representative who is running for the seat.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n-- \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d took home Best Picture at an Oscars that was rife with political moments. Dan Zak and Monica Hesse report: \u201c\u2018I think that the greatest thing our art does, and our industry does, is erase the lines in the sand,\u2019 said the winning film\u2019s creator, Guillermo del Toro, whose victory for best director was the fourth time in the past five years that a Mexican filmmaker took home that prize. \u2018We should continue doing that, when the world tells us to make them deeper.\u2019 The industry confronted its own mistreatment of women, and defied the isolationist and nationalist tone set by President Trump, in between doling out golden statuettes \u2014 which went to a wide spectrum of films, including the horror film \u2018Get Out,\u2019 whose writer-director Jordan Peele became the first black filmmaker to win best original screenplay, and the World War II action film \u2018Dunkirk,\u2019 which scooped up three technical awards.\u201d\n\nThere were many references to the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements: \u201c[Best Actress winner Frances McDormand] asked all the female nominees in the audience to stand. \u2018Okay, look around everybody, look around ladies and gentlemen,\u2019 McDormand said to a cheering audience. \u2018Because we all have stories to tell and projects we need financed. Don\u2019t talk to us about it at the parties tonight; invite us into your office in a couple days.\u2019 Nearly two and a half hours into the ceremony, three women who\u2019ve accused Weinstein of sexual abuse took the stage: Salma Hayek Pinault, Ashley Judd and Annabella Sciorra.\u201d\n\nHere is the complete list of winners.\n\n-- Host Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s jokes nodded to Hollywood\u2019s sexual misconduct scandals, Trump and Fox News.

(Andreas Solaro/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n-- Siren from Rome: The populist contagion has infected Italy. \u201cItalian populists of all leanings took a hammer to their country\u2019s old political order in Sunday elections, crushing traditional centrist parties in favor of a kaleidoscope of alternatives on the left and right and upending their former system,\u201d Michael Birnbaum reports from Rome. \u201cThe vote plunged Europe\u2019s fourth-largest economy into an uncertainty unique even to a nation known for cycling through leaders at a rapid clip. The shattering of the political landscape ruled out most plausible alliances among parties. But voters did not offer a clear direction for the future as they struggle with a stagnating economy and an influx of migrants, even as more than half voted for anti-establishment parties.\n\n\u201cThe surging outsider Five Star Movement captured more voters than any other party, about 32 percent, according to projections based on initial vote counts, meaning it is likely to play a key role in any governing coalition. In an extraordinary result, it appeared to have won nearly as many votes as the mainstream center-left and center-right parties combined. Italy\u2019s complicated electoral system could lead to initial results shifting slightly, but politicians of all stripes were treating the first projections as an earthquake.\n\n\u201cThe election drew the attention of anti-establishment crusaders from around the world, who saw the roiling populist energy of the campaign as a harbinger for other European nations. \u2026 Stephen K. Bannon was among the people who traveled to Rome to see the final days of the campaign. Formerly fringe ideas, such as deporting 600,000 migrants who have come to Italy without proper papers in recent years, have entered the mainstream.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cThe contours of the new regime are still unclear, but an old one is certainly passing,\u201d Ishaan Tharoor writes in his WorldViews newsletter. \u201cIn the weeks ahead, Italy's populists and ultranationalists will have to reckon with the actual prospect of taking power.\u201d\n\nGET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b\n\nThe nor\u2019easter that pounded the East Coast over the past few days claimed eight lives.

Jon Tester (Mont.) and Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), seen here with President Trump last year, support rolling back Dodd-Frank. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nTHE DECONSTRUCTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE:\n\n-- \u201cThe Senate is preparing to scale back the sweeping banking regulations passed after the 2008 financial crisis, with more than a dozen Democrats ready to give Republicans the votes they need to weaken one of President Barack Obama\u2019s largest legislative achievements,\u201d Erica Werner and Damian Paletta report. \u201cCongress\u2019s appetite for pulling back bank regulations shows the renewed clout of the financial sector in Washington, not just in the GOP but also among Democrats. Eight years after nearly every Senate Democrat backed a sweeping set of new rules for financial firms large and small, the party is now split, with moderates, several of them facing tough midterm election contests, working with the opposing party.\n\n\u201cThe core of the new bill exempts about two dozen financial companies with assets between $50 billion and $250 billion from the highest levels of scrutiny by the Federal Reserve \u2026 Supporters argue that the legislation would bring much-needed relief to midsize and regional banks that were treated like their much larger counterparts under the 2010 legislation known as Dodd-Frank. Opponents say it would weaken the oversight needed to stave off the type of dangerous lending and investing that brought the U.S. economy to its knees. The Senate is slated to take an initial procedural vote this week to move the measure forward, and if it eventually becomes law [as expected], it would be the most substantial weakening of Dodd-Frank since it was passed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the 10th anniversary of an enormous financial crash, Congress should not be passing laws to roll back regulations on Wall Street banks,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). \u201cThe bill permits about 25 of the 40 largest banks in America to escape heightened scrutiny and to be regulated as if they were tiny little community banks that could have no impact on the economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), a Banking Committee member and one of the new bill\u2019s leading Democratic supporters, said banks in his largely rural state have been going out of business in part because of the regulations imposed by Dodd-Frank. \u2026 Financial firms upped their campaign contributions to key Senate Democrats over the last year, with [Heidi] Heitkamp, [Joe] Donnelly and Tester becoming the top three Senate recipients of donations from commercial banks so far in the 2018 campaign cycle \u2026 Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who represents Wall Street and is often motivated by the desire to protect his vulnerable red-state incumbents, opposes the bill, but he has taken a largely hands-off approach to the debate thus far.\u201d\n\nThe offices of a shuttered coal operation are abandoned in Hi Hat, Ky. The Appalachian Regional Commission helps areas like this. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nA WINDOW INTO HOW WASHINGTON WORKS:\n\n-- Boston Globe A1, \u201cZombie agencies are nearly impossible to kill,\u201d by Annie Linskey: \u201cShortly after taking office, (Trump) identified 19 little-known federal offices for elimination. But despite his efforts to do away with what he sees as government waste, the bureaus are all still living, breathing, and spending taxpayer dollars. \u2026 From regional development commissions to arts councils, to offices responsible for fostering foreign aid, all these bureaus have continued their work ...\n\n\u201cA case study of sorts in bureaucratic survival is illustrated by the Appalachian Regional Commission, one of the agencies Trump initially wanted to get rid of last year. This roughly $150 million program might seem like an obvious place to slice. \u2026 As it turns out, the Appalachian Regional Commission has a lot going for it that might not be apparent at first glance. It crosses 13 state boundaries. In Washington math, that means 26 senators have a reason to care about it. (Twenty-three of those 26 senators voted to keep it alive, including 15 Republicans.) One of states served by the commission is Kentucky, which is home to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. In January Trump nominated one of McConnell\u2019s top staffers, Tim Thomas, to be the federal cochairman of the commission. This year, Trump didn\u2019t suggest eliminating the agency. It\u2019s off the kill list.\u201d\n\nTHE REST OF TRUMP'S AGENDA:\n\n-- \u201cTrump says American workers are hurt by immigration. But after ICE raided this Texas town, they never showed up,\u201d by Nick Miroff: \u201cIn deep-red Moore County, where Trump won 75 percent of the vote, the president\u2019s rhetoric on immigration has emboldened some of his supporters to freely vent their frustrations at the meatpacking plant they blame for bringing crime, drugs and civic decline. Their corner of northern Texas has been culturally and economically transformed, and they had never had an American president say the transformation was a bad thing. And yet, no one seemed to believe the Cactus plant would be filled anytime soon with American workers. People here were not even sure they were American jobs in the first place. At least not since the Vietnamese and Laotians showed up in the late 1970s, a few years after the plant opened.\u201d\n\n-- Administration officials sent mixed signals about the president\u2019s aluminum and steel tariffs on the Sunday shows. From Anne Gearan and Karoun Demirjian: \u201cWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro appeared to draw a firm line against case-by-case exemptions as he defended President Trump's sudden imposition of new trade premiums, which are likely to hit Canada and Europe hardest. \u2026 \u2018As soon as he starts exempting countries, he has to raise the tariff on everybody else,\u2019 the adviser said [on Fox News] when asked about Canada and the European Union. \u2026 In a separate interview on CNN, Navarro suggested Trump could indeed grant exceptions if doing so would serve U.S. interests. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that although he does not expect Trump to change his mind, he does not rule it out.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s constantly shifting policy positions have left congressional Republicans feeling directionless. John Wagner and Seung Min Kim report: \u201cThe legislative standoffs on guns and immigration have also underscored a larger reality about Trump\u2019s relationship with Capitol Hill: ... He has been unable to score a major legislative victory on any issue that was not already a leading priority of Republican lawmakers. \u2026 Trump\u2019s policy inconsistencies are sure to complicate and even stymie whatever legislative agenda he has this year, leaving a vacuum of policy details that lawmakers then attempt to fill.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson attends the Ministerial Meeting of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS in Kuwait City, Kuwait.

Mr. Tillerson has voiced skepticism that the United States is even capable of doing anything to counter the Russian threat.\u201d\n\n-- The State Department\u2019s 2019 budget calls for slashing funds for the National Endowment for Democracy, reports Josh Rogin. \u201c[The budget would also] disassemble [NED\u2019s] relationships with its core institutes, including the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute. For the NED and those institutes, the proposal is an assault not only on their organizations but also on the pro-democracy mission they are dedicated to. \u2026 The proposal initially came out of the Office of Management and Budget, even though the State Department did not formally ask for it. A senior OMB official told me the administration supports the NED\u2019s mission but wants to consolidate the funding streams to improve oversight and accountability.

From Karoun Demirjian: \u201c\u2018He can set his legacy: President Trump coming forth to something like this and putting his support behind will give Republicans enough cover to support this,\u2019 said Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.)[.] \u2026 But the senator cautioned against adding a provision to ban semiautomatic weapons, such as the AR-15, to that bill. \u2026 Manchin also endorsed a new effort from Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) that would let police or relatives of an individual who shows \u2018red flags\u2019 to petition the court to seize that person\u2019s firearms. \u2026 \u2018The president did a good job talking about \u2014 we should be able to do something to stop shootings like this,\u2019 Graham said.\u201d\n\n-- Senators facing tough reelections have been conspicuously silent in the gun debate. From the AP\u2019s Steve Peoples. \u201cThey often choose strategic silence rather than get crosswise with the National Rifle Association\u2019s die-hard supporters on the right or the growing movement of passionate gun control advocates on the left. The office of Nevada\u2019s senior senator, Republican Dean Heller, would not say why did he did not attend the White House meeting. Heller \u2026 has avoided the spotlight in the subsequent days as well, declining to address specifics about his positions on gun legislation. \u2026 North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, both Democrats running for reelection in states Trump won handily, have said nothing about gun violence from the Senate floor in recent days, but made statements honoring constituents who had recently passed away.\u201d\n\n-- A gun show in a conservative Chicago suburb banned sales of AR-15s. Mark Guarino reports: \u201cOrganizers halted an advertised raffle that would have awarded an AR-15 to the winner, and vendors were told they would not be allowed to sell the weapon at the monthly show. Frank Cesare \u2014 of the Pioneer Valley Sportsman\u2019s Association, which has hosted the show for more than 40 years \u2014 said the decision followed complaints the group received after the Parkland shooting and as gun-control advocates planned to protest. \u2026 Cesare said that the ban on AR-15s also would remain in place for April\u2019s show and that the club is \u2018waiting to see\u2019 what the mood is like before deciding on shows later in the year.\u201d\n\n-- Former Ohio attorney general Marc Dann (D) wrote an op-ed for the Cleveland Plain Dealer entitled, \u201cWhy I regret being in the pocket of the NRA:\u201d \u201cUnlike other special interests that exert influence by making campaign contributions, the gun groups spend the blood money they collect from gunmakers to misinform and then motivate voters who care about a single issue: the sanctity of the Second Amendment. \u2026 Anyone who thinks Social Security is the third rail of American politics has clearly never talked about firearms with an NRA member. While I didn't enter politics to be an advocate for the NRA, I quickly learned that unless I became one, I wouldn't be around to advocate for the issues I did care about. So I made a devil's bargain with myself: To stay in office, I adopted pro-gun positions that made me uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nThe president, accompanied by the first lady, waves to members of the media as they arrive Saturday at Andrews Air Force Base.

From Politico\u2019s Nancy Cook and Andrew Restuccia. \u201c[A]s president, he rarely comes into contact with regular people except in the structured setting of the White House or during tightly orchestrated events set up by staff[.] \u2026 It\u2019s another way that Trump has obliterated the norms of the presidency, according to interviews with more than 20 current and former White House officials, Trump friends and close advisers. Rather than trying to project an air of accessibility, Trump has unapologetically stuck to his insular White House life, avoiding and more or less eliminating the optics of the president appearing in public as a citizen. The approach keeps Trump in his comfort zone but makes it harder for him to do the work of being president[.]\u201d\n\n-- HUD Secretary Ben Carson reportedly considered quitting amid recent budget battles. The New York Times\u2019s Glenn Thrush reports: \u201c\u2018There are more complexities here than in brain surgery,\u2019 Mr. Carson said in an interview last week. \u2018Doing this job is going to be a very intricate process.\u2019 \u2026 While Mr. Trump treats him with respect, he views him as a beta \u2018winner,\u2019 not as a \u2018killer,\u2019 the alpha in his organizational taxonomy, according to several White House officials. That lack of influence was painfully apparent during the internal debate before the release of Mr. Trump\u2019s budget, which would help pay for increases in military and Homeland Security spending with steep cuts to HUD\u2019s Community Development Block Grant and core housing programs. \u2026 In private, \u2026 Mr. Carson has been profoundly frustrated, telling friends he would find it difficult to stay if deep cuts to two housing programs, focused on helping the elderly and the disabled, were enacted.\u201d\n\n-- As other high-profile Trump advisers have left exited, Kellyanne Conway has managed to hold on. The New York Times\u2019s Katie Rogers and Maggie Haberman write: \u201cIn a White House with the highest turnover rates in decades, she has survived by knowing when to step back from the spotlight, keeping the president\u2019s ear, focusing on a policy issue significant to the poor and working class, and maintaining an unflinching loyalty to President Trump even as she outmaneuvers rivals on the staff. The public criticism hasn\u2019t abated, but Ms. Conway\u2019s skin is thicker than it used to be. \u2026 [O]ne of her biggest strengths, those who know her say, is that she has always understood whom she works for. Loyalty to her clients always came easily, but this time, her client just happens to be in the Oval Office.\u201d\n\n-- A group of Trump superfans greet him as he crosses a bridge every time he visits Mar-a-Lago. Lori Rozsa reports: \u201cThey call themselves the Bridge Family. \u2026 They\u2019re connected by a fanaticism for the president \u2014 and by their willingness to show up whenever they hear that his motorcade will cross the Southern Boulevard Bridge. \u2026 On the other side of the street, about a dozen protesters waved signs reading \u2018Corruption\u2019 and \u2018Impeach.\u2019 But on the side the president could see, it was all fans \u2014 about 60 of them[.] \u2026 He\u2019s been known to stop the motorcade and jump out of his armored SUV to greet fans on the bridge. And last year, in March and December, he ordered his staff to bring some of the Bridge Family to Mar-a-Lago.\u201d\n\nDemonstrators hold a sit-in outside the White House during the People's Climate Movement in April. (Eric Thayer/Bloomberg News)\n\nMORE ON THE MIDTERMS:\n\n-- A recently founded PAC is helping scientists run for office. Ben Guarino and Laurie McGinley report: \u201cNamed for the first three digits of pi, 314 Action describes itself as the vanguard of \u2018the pro-science resistance.\u2019 The group\u2019s founder, Shaughnessy Naughton, said 7,000 people have responded to the group\u2019s call to run for office. The group has also assembled a network of about 400,000 donors eager to support candidates who back science-based policies. While a few scientist-candidates are running as independents, most are Democrats making their first foray into party politics. (More than 80 percent of scientists in a 2014 Pew survey identified as Democrats or Democrat-leaning.) 314 Action is working with 30 congressional candidates across the country and expects to formally endorse about half that number.\u201d\n\n-- The National Journal\u2019s Josh Kraushaar argues that, if Republicans lose the special election in Pennsylvania, it will be \u201can unmistakable verdict that the healthy economy and Trump tax cuts will be overshadowed by the administration\u2019s dysfunction and roiling suburban anger.\u201d \u201cEven a close loss in such a reliably conservative area would raise red flags that Democrats are on the verge of a major landslide in the November midterms. \u2026 Though the economy may play to the GOP\u2019s advantage, the culture wars have turned squarely in the Democratic Party\u2019s favor \u2014 and that\u2019s what matters in today\u2019s politics. \u2026 Republicans are eager to pin a disappointing result in this election on their candidate \u2014 state Rep. Rick Saccone\u2014but the reality is the race is being defined on Trump\u2019s terms.\u201d\n\n-- A new poll finds Virginia Republicans have not consolidated support around a candidate to oppose Sen. Tim Kaine. Jenna Portnoy reports: \u201cCorey Stewart, the self-styled mini-Trump who nearly won the gubernatorial nomination last year, has a slight lead, but 66 percent of voters are undecided, the [Wason Center for Public Policy] poll found. The primary is June 12. The other candidates are evangelical pastor E.W. Jackson; Bert Mizusawa, a retired major general in the U.S. Army Reserve and foreign policy adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign; two-term state Del. Nicholas J. \u2018Nick\u2019 Freitas (R-Culpeper); and political newcomer Ivan Raiklin. Stewart enters as the most well-known candidate with the support of 16 percent of potential GOP primary voters.

The Somalis told of abuse on the flight, saying they were shackled with chains on their wrists, waists, and legs for more than 40 hours; forced to urinate in bottles or on themselves; and that ICE officers beat and threatened some passengers.

A giant American flag hangs above the stage at the center of the hall. \"All rise,\" says a clerk, and between 3,000 and 5,000 applicants for citizenship rise from their stackable chairs. Beyond them, another few thousand friends and relatives also stand. A black-robed judge takes his or her place behind a podium and leads the applicants through the Oath of Allegiance, some version of which has been required of new citizens since the country's first Naturalization Act was passed in 1790. \"I hereby declare,\" the oath begins, \"that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty.\" Once the applicants have sworn \"to bear true faith\" to \"the Constitution and the laws of the United States,\" and to take up arms on its behalf when required, each judge delivers a brief welcoming speech. \"We are a society of freedom,\" promised Judge Andr\u00e9 Birotte Jr. at a ceremony in October, \"where your dreams and aspirations will come true.\"\n\nRelated Jamil Smith: Jeff Sessions Is Suing California, and I Feel Fine It's easy to see why the Golden State would want this fight over immigration\n\nIt is at that point in the ceremony that an enormous image of the president's face takes shape on the screens at each side of the stage. Trump's eyes are squinted, his teeth even and small. He reads from a teleprompter, biting off the words: \"No matter where you come from or what faith you practice, this country is now your country.\" He makes it sound like a threat. At every ceremony I attended, applause for the video was sparse, but many of the people in the hall were there because of Trump. I interviewed dozens of them. Nearly half said that Trump's election had been a factor in their decision to seek citizenship. Sitting next to me at the ceremony in October was a man from El Salvador named Diego Ortiz. He told me he decided to seek citizenship after the election for a very practical reason: out of fear. \"I don't know what it's going to be like in a month,\" he confided.\n\nOrtiz had arrived in the U.S. in 1989, shortly before his third birthday. An aunt carried him over the border; his mother and brother had fled El Salvador's civil war two years earlier. In 1990, Congress granted Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, to Salvadorans like the Ortizes, allowing them to live and work here legally while it was unsafe to go home. He remembered waiting for hours with his mother in cold federal offices as she re-registered for TPS each year. After decades of anxiety, many missteps and thousands of dollars lost to fraudulent lawyers, Ortiz and his parents were granted permanent residency. Their trajectory is the sort that we talk about when we speak of the American Dream: His father found work as a landscaper and his mother cleaned houses, but Ortiz finished college and now works for an environmental advocacy group in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nAfter Ortiz picked up his naturalization certificate and joined 3,419 other newly minted citizens filing slowly out of the Convention Center, the court broke for lunch and convened again promptly at 1:30 p.m. to swear in another 3,542 people. For most of American history, all of this \u2013 the pageantry and the vast bureaucracy behind it \u2013 would have been unimaginable. In 1885, when the president's grandfather, Friedrich Trumpf \u2013 his family had already transitioned from Drumpf \u2013 sailed into New York Harbor from Germany, Ellis Island had not yet opened. There was no federal immigration department and no border patrol. Visitors were not expected to carry passports or visas. To most Americans, the notion of an \"illegal immigrant\" would have elicited confusion. Young Trumpf likely faced a cursory examination to make sure he was not a \"convict, lunatic, idiot.\" Then his name and age were recorded in a handwritten ledger along with his \"calling\": \"none.\"\n\nToday, the portion of Americans born abroad is roughly the same as it was then \u2013 about 13 percent. Little else remains the same. There are A visas and O visas now, SQs and H1-Bs. There are more than 15,000 immigration lawyers trained to navigate an almost impossibly complex array of laws and procedures administered and enforced by the 100,000 employees of three federal agencies with a combined budget of up to $27 billion. They are the ones who decide who to keep out, who to let in and, quite literally, who we as a nation may yet become. They run a machine made up of courtrooms and offices in hundreds of federal buildings around the country, of cells in both government-owned and private prisons, of fleets of vans for transporting prisoners and SUVs that patrol the border as well as streets and neighborhoods hundreds of miles from it. The machine functions to sort humans into piles \u2013\u00ad ejecting some, granting some full acceptance, condemning others to a life at the margins. It helps to produce, and enforce, the unacknowledged caste system that orders our society. Last year, it deported 226,119 people, granted permanent residency to over a million others and citizenship to 703,000 more.\n\nThe machine answers now to Trump, but it was Obama who perfected its deportation apparatus, ejecting nearly 3 million immigrants during his two terms. We owe much of its infrastructure, from an expanding detention system to the legal framework underpinning most detentions and deportations, to Bill Clinton. Whatever they say on the campaign trail, whether they promise inclusion and a path to citizenship or shout about anchor babies and MS-13, politicians of both parties have stoked it and maintained it \u2013 and the social hierarchy that it perpetuates \u2013 with meticulous care. No matter the rhetoric, the machine continues to hum. It hums when the conversation gives way to shouting, and it keeps humming when the pundits move on to other things. But to the human beings caught up in its workings, it feels less like a machine than a huge and fickle monster, by turns generous, petty, merciless and cruel.\n\nBut rhetoric matters. Trump ran for office in large part on a promise to keep immigrants out. As a result, the national conversation on immigration has never in recent memory been more panicked, divisive and calculated to spread fear in immigrants and citizens alike. In the 14 months since his inauguration, Trump has been unable to achieve any of his legislative goals on immigration, but he has nonetheless had a powerful impact, sharply restricting travel from six Muslim-majority nations; rescinding an Obama-era policy that allowed 800,000 immigrants who arrived in the United States as children to live and work without fear of deportation; terminating the Temporary Protected Status that permitted nearly 300,000 Central Americans and Haitians to live in this country with some measure of security; and unleashing Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to stage ever-more spectacular, punitive and headline-grabbing arrests. The crackdown has been particularly harsh in California, which is home to a quarter of the country's immigrants.\n\nTrump's policies have provoked fear and uncertainty at every rank of the ladder \u2013 from the relatively privileged to the absolutely excluded, from those for whom the security of citizenship will come easily to those for whom it will remain a distant dream. What follows is a snapshot of the machine, a portrait of the monster, told through the lives of five residents of Los Angeles county, revealing how their fortunes and their dreams have changed since Trump took office, and what sort of a country we are becoming.\n\nStefan Ruiz\n\nThe Door Swings Open\n\n\"I sort of feel guilty,\" Helen Kennedy confessed the first time we spoke. \"I know how lucky I am.\" That was July. Three months earlier her dad had fetched her Green Card from the mailbox \u2013 in his underwear, she laughed \u2013 outside her parents' home in Dorset, in southwest England. Six months before that, her husband, Kai, who was born in New York, had filed the first of many forms to request permanent residency in the United States on her behalf. That would have been an I-130 form: \"Petition for Alien Relative.\" When the alien in question happens to be a spouse, a solid I-130, one Los Angeles immigration lawyer told me, is \"like the platinum card.\" There is no smoother path to living legally as a foreigner in the United States. The dangers of \"horrible chain migration,\" to borrow the president's phrase, have become a common Republican talking point \u2013 the White House proposed continuing to allow citizens to sponsor their spouses and kids, but not their parents, adult children or siblings. Ironically, the family-unification provisions of U.S. immigration law were originally instituted as a gift to the nativist right. The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act ushered out per-country quotas but attempted to maintain the country's then overwhelmingly white majority by freely granting citizenship to the immediate family of existing U.S. citizens, most of whom were of European ancestry.\n\nKennedy is 37 and tall, with striking blue eyes and blond hair that tumbles to her shoulders. She had been to the U.S. several times as a kid, to Orlando. \"It was the Nineties, so obviously mum and dad had a timeshare.\" Her father, a partner in an accounting firm, fantasized about moving to Florida for good, but however sun-deprived she sometimes felt, it never occurred to Kennedy that she might end up in the States.\n\nShe and Kai met in 2010, at a pub. He is even taller than she is and as reserved as she is chatty. He had been in London for nearly a decade, doing web design. She was acting, doing improv, writing. They dated, moved in together, got tired of the London party scene and moved to a quaint commuter town. But quaint also meant stodgy, and they didn't fit in. In 2015, Kennedy flew for the first time to Los Angeles. The weather was gorgeous, of course, and she met with writers and producers and found a manager who wanted to work with her. She and Kai began to talk about leaving England. The next summer they were married. In September 2016, Kai filed that I-130. \"Oh, well,\" Kennedy thought, \"it might not work out, but let's give it a little bash. If it doesn't, we'll still have a lovely life here.\"\n\nLast February, Kai found a job, moved to L.A. and started looking for an apartment. In March, the day came for Kennedy's interview at the U.S. embassy in London. She looked down and saw that her hands were shaking. She had expected something formal, she said, \"an officious-looking man in a suit in the middle of a room with a clock ticking,\" but the official who interviewed her was quite friendly. It was \"almost like a fun and lighthearted conversation.\" In less than 15 minutes, it was over. He told her that she had been accepted and could expect her Green Card to arrive within two weeks.\n\nKennedy left the embassy with mixed emotions. Before her interview, she said, she had struck up a conversation with a family in the waiting room, a young couple with a little boy. They were applying for visas to visit the U.S. She didn't know where they were from, she said, but she knew they were Muslims, and she knew that the Trump administration had been trying to keep Muslims out of the U.S. The woman was fully veiled, with only her eyes showing. \"She had beautiful eyes, these big, brown, loving eyes.\" In the short time that they sat together, Kennedy said, \"we had a really in-depth conversation about our life plans, about California.\" The husband, a doctor, spoke \"very eloquently about California, the smell of the pine trees, just the abundance of nature.\" She watched them go in for their interview and come out a few minutes later, downcast. Things had apparently gone poorly. She didn't talk to them again and never learned exactly what happened, but the contrast between their fortunes and hers unnerved her. Telling the story three months later, she wiped away a tear. \"I feel quite guilty,\" she told me. \"I know how different it can be.\"\n\nStefan Ruiz\n\nThe Line Is Long\n\nSwati Narang came to the U.S. 12 years ago from India with her father and a younger sister. She was 20 then. Her dad was a programmer and had been offered a job by a tech company in Southern California. His employer applied for a visa on his behalf, an H-1B, which allows companies to sponsor individuals with \"specialized knowledge\" necessary for their work. It may not be the golden ticket, but the H-1B at least opens the door. It must be renewed every three years and, with a petition from the applicant's boss, can be a step toward the security of a Green Card. With so much power in the hands of employers, accounts of abuse aren't hard to find. Still, H-1B holders, most of whom work in the tech sector, generally do extremely well. Their average salary is more than $90,000. During the presidential campaign, Trump promised to \"institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers\" and to \"end forever the use of the H-1B.\" (He also at various times appeared to support the program, and to not understand what it is.) Already though, only 85,000 H-1Bs are awarded each year; applications wildly outnumber available slots, and the government distributes them by lottery.\n\nMoving here, Narang said, \"the first thing that hits you is loneliness.\" She had grown up in what she describes as \"a very small town\" in Punjab, surrounded by extended family. She knew no one in L.A. Her Indian bachelor's degree, she learned, wouldn't be recognized here, so she enrolled at Cal State to make up the required coursework. \"Since then,\" she said, \"I've never had the free time to think about it.\" She earned a master's in taxation and found a job as an accountant. When her post-graduation training period expired \u2013 foreign students are generally permitted to work for a year after completing their studies \u2013 her boss petitioned for an H-1B.\n\n\"The feeling of waiting in the long queues is awful. Your remaining life is in the hands of this person who is standing on the other side of the window.\"\n\nShe never expected to stay here, Narang said, but with time \"it felt like a much better way to live.\" In the town where she grew up, \"the female is supposed to look after the home and nurture and all that. I love independence.\" Her eyes lit up at the word. Without planning to, she put down roots. She married, had a son, divorced and married again. Four years ago, she took a job with LegalZoom, the online legal-services company, where she works as a \"product analytics manager\" \u2013 something to do with marketing, she explained \u2013 again on an H-1B. She and her husband, who is also Indian and here on an H-1B, bought a house in Moorpark, in the outer bands of suburban L.A. She bought a Tesla too, and likes to drive it fast. She made sure to teach her son Hindi, but he otherwise sounds like a very American boy. He prefers basketball to soccer and shuttles after school between tae kwon do and swim lessons. Last year, at Narang's request, LegalZoom petitioned for a Green Card for her. She expects to wait, she sighed, \"forever.\" (I spoke with several of her co-workers who were also Indians on H-1Bs; they had been waiting for between four and six years.)\n\nBut anxiety is in the air. Last April, Trump issued an executive order instructing Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a fierce critic of H-1Bs, and the secretaries of labor, state, and homeland security to \"suggest reforms\" to the program. Many tech executives, some of whom are immigrants themselves, insist they cannot find enough qualified American workers to stay competitive. In the meantime, the administration appears to be doing what it can to gum up the process: The number of H-1B applications challenged by the government is up 45 percent. \"You keep hearing about it,\" Narang told me. \"People are getting stuck.\"\n\nNarang did her best to convince me that she has no political opinions whatsoever and isn't concerned about the future, but the first time we spoke, she was more forthright. \"I'm so sick to my heart with the whole process,\" she said. On her last trip to India, she said, she had been required to go to the U.S. embassy in Delhi for an interview before getting her visa stamped. \"The feeling of waiting in the long queues is awful,\" she said. \"You can see when people are accepted and you can see when they are rejected.\" She had plenty of time to observe which immigration agents seemed lenient and which seemed harsh, and to wonder if she had chosen the wrong line. Three people ahead of her were rejected. \"Your remaining life is in the hands of this person who is standing on the other side of the window.\" Her husband made it through and went outside to wait for her, and pray. When she couldn't remember the date of her college graduation, she briefly feared that she wouldn't be allowed to return. \"If they deny me, what am I supposed to do, start my life over?\"\n\nStefan Ruiz\n\nThe Door Swings Shut\n\nWhen Patrick Dela Cruz was 11 years old, his mother told him they were going to Disneyland. He had just finished sixth grade in the Philippine countryside, about 60 miles outside of Manila. The trip, she said, would be his graduation present. He had never been in a car before, much less an airplane, so it goes without saying that Disneyland was a blast. He was excited to get home to tell his classmates about it, but the weeks soon turned to months and they were still in California. Only later did he figure out that they had never planned to return.\n\n\n\nThat was 10 years ago. He enrolled in middle school in Carson, in the working-class flats south of L.A. His adolescence was a lonely one. He didn't speak English, which made it hard to make friends. His mother, like his aunts and many other Filipinos, found work doing in-home care for the elderly, so he only saw her on weekends. He was in 10th grade when she was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer and decided to fly home to the Philippines to spend what time she had left with her family. Dela Cruz made what he describes as the hardest decision of his life: to stay. The last time he spoke with his mother, on Skype, he said, \"She was apologizing for not being everything I wanted. I told her, 'You've given me everything. You've given me an opportunity.'\"\n\n\n\nIf he had been born 15 years earlier, Dela Cruz might have easily joined the thousands who are sworn in as citizens each month. Until 1996, if you had been in the country for at least seven years and could prove that you would suffer \"extreme hardship\" if deported, you could apply for permanent residency. But Bill Clinton signed an immigration-reform bill that year that made legalization all but impossible for most, consigning Dela Cruz and millions of others to the shadows. When he graduated from high school, he learned that he was not eligible for federal financial aid or government-backed loans. He had planned to apply to college, but was told that he would have to enroll as an international student, which would push the cost of tuition far out of his reach. He couldn't work legally either, or drive a car. For nearly two years, he was in limbo, and depressed. \"I felt useless,\" he said. He went to the recruitment center at a nearby mall and tried enlisting in the military, but the recruiters wouldn't take him. He was crying as he left the mall.\n\n\"There's always that fear that at any time somebody can come knocking and take you away.\"\n\nFortunately, one of his aunts learned about DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the policy instituted by the Obama administration in 2012 to offer temporary protection to immigrants who had arrived in the U.S. as children. If Clinton-era reforms had relegated a vast segment of the population to a ghostly state of official non-existence, DACA would give some relief to the so-called Dreamers, kids like de la Cruz who effectively knew no other country. It provided the most tenuous protection. The federal government was committing only to not deporting DACA recipients for renewable periods of two years at a time, and to allowing them to work and drive.\n\nFor de la Cruz, it was a godsend. Suddenly he could afford to go to school. He got a job in a clothing store, and then a tea shop, and devoted himself to his studies. He became vice president of the Asian students association, joined a student group of undocumented immigrants, another for LGBTQ kids, and an off-campus advocacy group for Filipino migrants. He allowed himself to think about the future. His bachelor's would be in health and fitness, but he could go to graduate school and get a master's, or even a doctorate, in physical therapy. Still, DACA could be rescinded in an instant. \"There's always that fear,\" he said, \"that at any time somebody can come knocking and take you away.\"\n\nTrump's election hit hard. Everything Dela Cruz had achieved, he knew, might be taken from him. \"I feel like my confidence has been stripped away,\" he told me last June. Early in September, four days before Jeff Sessions made it official, Dela Cruz heard that Trump had decided to repeal DACA. He spent the weekend in his room, feeling hopeless. That Monday he sat in his kinesiology class with two windows open on his laptop: one for his lecture notes and the other to watch Sessions insist that \"we are a people of compassion and we are a people of law.\" Trump would allow DACA to expire in March 2018, and with it the hopes of 700,000 young, undocumented Americans. \"It's heartbreaking,\" Dela Cruz said. \"You give hope to someone and you just tear it up and take it away.\"\n\nDela Cruz had already renewed his status before the attorney general's announcement, so if Trump keeps his word, he should be safe from deportation until June of 2019. But Dela Cruz saw little reason to trust the authorities. Applying for DACA had been a risk. It meant coming out from the shadows and telling the government that you were here, and where you lived. \"They have my information in the system,\" Dela Cruz said. Still, whatever the risks, he intends to speak out as much as he possibly can. \"I've been silent,\" he said, \"having the benefit of working and being able to go to school, but that's being taken away. I can't be silent anymore.\"\n\nStefan Ruiz\n\nThe Bolt Is Locked\n\nThree flags fly in the parking lot of the Adelanto ICE Processing Center: the stars and stripes, the California state flag, and a green, white and blue banner bearing the logo of the GEO Group, one of the country's largest private prison firms. R\u00f3mulo Av\u00e9lica-Gonz\u00e1lez lived in Southern California for 26 years without knowing that this place existed, or suspecting that he would lose six months of his life to its walls. When I was finally able to meet him a few days after his release in September, he had the dazed and grateful look that I've encountered on the faces of disaster survivors, as if it had been a storm or an earthquake that had upended his family's life.\n\nAv\u00e9lica grew up in the Mexican state of Nayarit. What little work could be found there paid barely enough to eat, so in 1991, at 22, he jumped the border in Tijuana. Crossing was easier then, he told me, in Spanish. \"You just had to run really fast.\" (In 1994, the U.S. began increasing enforcement along urban sections of the border, pushing migrants into ever-more remote areas. Thousands have died in the desert since.) A few months later, his wife, Norma, followed him. She would give birth to four daughters, all of them U.S. citizens. Over the years, Av\u00e9lica did the sort of work that undocumented immigrants end up doing in L.A.: He worked at construction sites, for a food manufacturer, a produce distributor, and for the past five years as a cook in a taco shop not far from his home in the Eastside neighborhood of Lincoln Heights. He had two run-ins with the law. Unable to legally register his car, he used tags that a friend had given him, and in 1998 was pulled over and charged with a misdemeanor for receipt of stolen property. Ten years later, he was pulled over again and tested at just over the legal limit for a DUI.\n\nAt the beginning of 2017, those incidents were far from his mind. The Obama administration deported immigrants in far greater numbers than Trump has so far, but it did so with little fanfare. Under Obama's watch, ICE set a policy of avoiding arrests in \"sensitive locations\" such as churches and schools, but the Trump administration has ignored this guideline. After the election, news began spreading of arrests that seemed calculated to provoke panic: officers waiting outside churches, hauling people off in hospitals and courthouses, sending a clear message that nowhere was safe. In the first three months of Trump's presidency, arrests by deportation officers would leap 41 percent over the same period one year earlier.\n\nAv\u00e9lica continued his usual routine \u2013 going to work, taking his kids to school, picking them up from practice \u2013 only now he did it with fear. Always, he said, \"I felt uneasy.\" Still, on the morning of February 28th, 2017, when he noticed lights flashing in his rear-view mirror, Av\u00e9lica assumed it was the police, and that they were after someone else. He had just dropped his youngest daughter at school, and was on his way to drop off her sister, Fatima, who was then 13. The cars behind him were black and unmarked, the kind that swoop in for drug raids. When he pulled to the curb to let them pass, one swerved in front of him, boxing him in. Fatima, in the back seat, took out her phone and began shooting video. The footage is shaky, blurry through the windshield. You can see Av\u00e9lica in a green knit cap pushed up against the ICE officers' car. Mainly you hear Fatima's sobs. On YouTube, the video now has more than 600,000 views.\n\nWithout that video, Av\u00e9lica told me six months later, \"we wouldn't be sitting here.\" He would have been deported that day. But Trump's election brought about another change: organized resistance to immigration authorities with an efficiency that would have been hard to imagine a few months earlier. The ICE officers took Av\u00e9lica to a basement cell in the federal detention center in downtown L.A. His older daughters rushed over to visit him. He was crying, said Brenda, the eldest at 25. \"My dad doesn't cry.\" A little while later, a guard told him that in three hours he would be put in a van and driven to Tijuana. Despite his 26 years in the U.S., he was never given the phone number of an attorney or an advocacy group, or of anyone who could help him to mount some defense. In the meantime, though, the administration at his children's school had begun to mobilize, calling immigrant-rights groups, lawyers, elected officials. Fatima's video began to spread on social media. Protesters gathered outside the jail to block the vans from leaving. Just before they were scheduled to leave, Av\u00e9lica learned he wouldn't be going. Alan Diamante, the lawyer the school helped find for him, had filed an emergency stay with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Instead of south, to Mexico, he was driven 85 miles northeast, to Adelanto, on the edge of the Mojave Desert. This counted as a victory.\n\nThe criminal alien \u2013 the \"bad hombre\" in the president's words \u2013 has long been a figment of the racist imagination. Study after study has shown that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. Until the mid-1990s, the government rarely saw the need to imprison immigrants at all. But Clinton-era reforms instituted mandatory detention for all non-citizens convicted of a so-called aggravated felony, a category that included murder and rape but also many crimes that don't usually count as felonies under criminal law, like receiving stolen property, even just a license plate. At an annual cost of more than $2 billion, ICE now incarcerates as many as 400,000 immigrants a year in more than 200 county jails and private detention centers. The two largest private-prison corporations, the GEO Group and CoreCivic, have reaped enormous profits, and donate generously to politicians of both parties. In August 2016, Obama's Justice Department ordered a gradual phase-out of federal contracts with private prisons. GEO and CoreCivic stocks plummeted. The two corporations would together donate half a million dollars to Trump's inaugural committee, and hundreds of thousands more to Republican PACs. One month after Trump took office, Sessions rescinded the Obama order on private prisons. GEO and CoreCivic's investments seem to have paid off.\n\n\"I didn't know how long I would be there, but I knew I wouldn't last long,\" Av\u00e9lica recalled of his arrival at Adelanto. The food was meager. Av\u00e9lica suffers from diabetes. In the first two months, he lost 18 pounds. His head always hurt. He felt weak all the time. The prison doctor put him on medication, but it didn't help. Almost two years earlier, 29 members of Congress had signed a letter to ICE and the inspector general at the Justice Department voicing their concern that GEO was \"failing to provide adequate medical treatment\" at the Adelanto facility. Between December 2016 and the end of last July, three prisoners there died. Five others attempted suicide. \"It's very easy to get depressed there,\" Av\u00e9lica said. \"People give up.\"\n\nAv\u00e9lica's daughters drove out on the weekends. For the family, Brenda told me, his arrest \"was like a tornado hit us.\" Emotionally and financially, he had been the one holding the family together. At the end of each visit, she said, they would joke to their father and say, \"OK, let's go.\" Then the guards would lead him off, and close the door, and they would get in the car and drive home in silence. Diamante pushed on. Except for the attention it has received, he told me, there was nothing unusual about Av\u00e9lica's situation. \"I see cases like this every day.\"\n\nIn June, a judge vacated the criminal convictions that had been the basis of Av\u00e9lica's deportation order. On August 6th, an immigration court threw out the deportation order too. Av\u00e9lica stayed on at Adelanto. Finally, on August 30th, an immigration judge agreed to release him on a $6,000 bond. Nine camera crews were waiting outside the prison parking lot. In the weeks that followed, Av\u00e9lica transformed into an activist, talking to community groups and lobbying politicians. \"The only way to fight injustice,\" he told me, \"is for the people to raise their voice.\" The last time I saw him, he was just back from speaking at a rally in Sacramento, and on his way to a meeting with the Mexican Consul. But on the day of his release, it was time for celebration. People had banded together, and this time, they had won. There was a party for Av\u00e9lica at the taco shop where he had worked, which his friends and family had decorated with banners and balloons. His first stop in L.A., though, was at the Mission San Conrado, just north of downtown, to give thanks for his freedom to God, to Saint Jude \u2013 the patron saint of the impossible, the desperate and the hopeless \u2013 and to the Virgin of Guadalupe, who looks over the Americas, regardless of borders.\n\nStefan Ruiz\n\nOutside the Law\n\nGuadalupe Barrientos is not her real name. Her story is long and tangled and she tells it with urgency, jumping easily from laughter to tears to laughter again. She laughs so often and with so much warmth that you might not guess how much trauma and loss she has squeezed into the 51 years she has spent on this planet. Barrientos was raised in El Salvador, and was a teenager when civil war broke out. She crossed the border to Guatemala and at 18 married the man who would become the father of her four children. He drove a minibus, drank too much and beat her brutally and often. He once fractured her skull with the butt of a pistol, she said. She needed 24 stitches in her scalp. In 2004, fearing for her life, she fled. A friend paid a coyote to bring her to California. The journey took two weeks, by truck, by car, by foot. Her plan was simple: to work and bring her children over so that they could live together as a family, without fear.\n\nBarrientos found a job as a housekeeper for a family in Hancock Park, the oldest of L.A.'s wealthy neighborhoods. She was what we would call a \"live-in,\" though the Spanish word she used translates more accurately as \"locked in.\" She would arrive on Monday morning and work into the night until Saturday: cleaning, cooking, babysitting and helping another worker, a Filipina, look after the family's elderly mother. She slept on a mattress on the floor of the children's room. For this she was paid, she said, $300 a week. On her days off she worked as a dishwasher and as a helper at a taqueria. She stayed for three years. Later she found work selling food \u2013 hot dogs, quesadillas, pupusas \u2013 from a cart, at first at a car wash and more recently on a street corner in South Central. She handed over her profits to the man who owned the cart, who gave her $40 for each eight-hour day. In recent months, she said, police have been cracking down on unlicensed vendors. Fearing arrest, she quit.\n\nBringing her children over has also proven difficult. Her oldest son, now 32, made it as far as Boston, but was later deported. Her next youngest made the perilous journey through Mexico by freight train and crossed the border with a group of 30 other migrants. The smugglers they had paid to guide them imprisoned them for two weeks in a house in Phoenix in an attempt to extort ransoms from their families. Her son broke the windows and helped the others to escape, Barrientos said, but ICE soon picked them up. She showed me a photo of him wearing a blue prison uniform and a look of anxious expectation. He was at a private immigration prison in Eloy, Arizona, at the time, just before his deportation. Back in Guatemala, she said, he had been kidnapped twice by gang members. His father had refused to pay them protection money \u2013 bus drivers are a common target \u2013 so they abducted and tortured him to sway the old man. When her son heard they were coming for him a third time, and were planning to kill him, he swallowed a powerful pesticide. He called her first, and begged forgiveness. \"I don't want to do it,\" he told her, \"but I don't want them to kill me.\" She wept at the memory. He was 21 when he died. He left behind a little boy, a grandson who Barrientos supports but has never been able to meet.\n\nA third son made it. After being shot by gangsters and spending three days in a coma, he fled north at 17 as part of the wave of Central American children who arrived in the U.S. in 2014, escaping the violence that has ravaged the region. He was ultimately granted asylum, and now lives in Los Angeles with his girlfriend, who recently gave birth to a son. The Trump administration has since canceled the Obama-era program for granting refugee status to fleeing Central American minors, and last June, ICE began cracking down on undocumented parents suspected of paying smugglers to bring their children here.\n\n\"I wish people understood it's out of necessity that people come here. It's not because they want to.\"\n\nBarrientos has a daughter too, a 14-year-old who was an infant when Barrientos had to leave her behind. She worries over her constantly: Her daughter's age and gender make her particularly vulnerable to the violence that has overtaken Guatemala, and to the many dangers of the journey north. For now, Barrientos sends her all the money she can, and makes do with photos and phone calls. \"She's like me in miniature,\" she told me with pride, down to the birthmark on her cheek.\n\nIf she had known to apply and had been able to afford a lawyer, Barrientos would likely have been granted asylum when she arrived here 14 years ago. It is now almost certainly too late. Until last year, she was able to hold out some small degree of hope that with enough struggle, enough marches and organizing and pressure from below, Congress might pass an immigration-reform package that would eventually give her some relief, that would allow her to work with dignity at a decent wage, to visit her children, to sleep through the night without fearing that ICE officers might tear her from her home. Trump's election has slammed every door shut. Barrientos can see no exit to the fear and heartache to which our laws have condemned her. She does not believe that is a reason to give up.\n\nIn 2010, three days after her son's death and one day after his funeral, which she was not able to attend, Barrientos marched in a May Day rally for immigrant rights in downtown Los Angeles. She wept through the entire demonstration, she said, but it was important to her to be there, to be counted, to be heard. \"This country has to realize that without us, it's nothing,\" she told me. \"We're the ones who make the country move. We're the ones who give everything.\"\n\nThe Door Swings Shut Again\n\nThree weeks after Diego Ortiz became a U.S. citizen, the Trump administration rescinded the Temporary Protected Status that previous administrations had extended to more than 5,000 Nicaraguans. Two weeks after that, the Department of Homeland Security announced that 59,000 Haitians with TPS had 18 months to leave the country. Ortiz was dismayed by the news. \"I wish people understood,\" he said, \"that it's out of necessity that people come here. It's not because they want to.\"\n\nBut the door that had opened for Ortiz and his family, that had allowed his parents to escape with their lives and raise their children without fear, was about to swing closed behind them: In January, Trump ended TPS for nearly 200,000 Salvadorans. And the administration continues its encroachment on immigrant protections: Earlier this month, in an escalation of the Justice Department's attack on sanctuary laws, Jeff Sessions filed a lawsuit against the state of California, to force state and local officials to cooperate with ICE. Sweeps like the one that tore R\u00f3mulo Av\u00e9lica from his family have become the new norm, especially in California: ICE arrested 212 people in five days of raids in and around Los Angeles in mid-February, 150 more in the Bay Area over one weekend in February, and another 115 over three days last week in San Diego. Wall or no wall, America is getting smaller, and the machine is getting uglier.\n\n\n\nBut that is not the only change. In the long run, and perhaps well before that, Trump's reign of fear may produce some unplanned results. Many of the new citizens I interviewed at naturalization ceremonies talked about the sense of helplessness they experienced in November 2016, of not having a vote, or a voice in the only country they considered home. Next time, and the time after that, they promised, they would not let the opportunity slide by. In the meantime, Trump's actions have already taught Patrick de la Cruz and the children of R\u00f3mulo Av\u00e9lica, and their classmates, and many thousands of other immigrant youth, with papers and without, that the only way to live in this country with dignity is to stand up, to organize, and to fight.", "title": "L.A. Immigrants, Trump: Dreamers, Asylum-Seekers, Green Card Holders"}, {"url": "https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/02/the-russians-colluded-massively-with-democrats/", "content": "Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton at a campaign event in Charlotte, N.C., July 5, 2016 (Reuters/Jonathan Ernst)\n\nMueller scours Team Trump for Russian collusion as Dems marinate in it\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller and his investigators resemble axe-wielding firefighters frantically stomping through a house and not finding so much as a lit birthday candle. Meanwhile, the home next door burns to the basement.\n\nTeam Mueller\u2019s never-ending hunt for reds in October 2016 has found zero evidence of Russian collusion among Team Trump. In contrast, Russian collusion among Democrats has been as hard to miss as a California wildfire. And yet they still miss it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeam Mueller did find Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2014 and how! The February 16 announcement of federal criminal indictments against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies was a Cold War flashback. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told journalists that Russians close to the Kremlin infiltrated the last presidential campaign \u201cto promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy.\u201d\n\nBut Rosenstein threw a bucket of wet sand onto the Left\u2019s simmering narrative that DJT = KGB. The Russian meddling began in 2014, well before Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign commenced. The Russians promoted Vermont senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s Democratic-primary bid and Green-party nominee Jill Stein\u2019s general-election effort. After Trump won, the Russians organized pro-Trump and anti-Trump demonstrations, once in New York City on the same day. They also staged an anti-Trump rally in Charlotte.\n\nFurthermore, Rosenstein said, \u201cThere is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in the alleged unlawful activity.\u201d Thus far, anyone on Team Trump who might have worked with Russians did so after being hoodwinked, not due to treason \u2014 as Democrats have shouted for more than a year.\n\nAlso, none of this should comfort Hillary Clinton. Rosenstein said: \u201cThere is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.\u201d So, rather than blame Russia for her epic fail, Hillary finally should concede that she lost a mismanaged campaign that barely visited Michigan and avoided Wisconsin as if it had been quarantined.\n\nThroughout these events, the president of the United States was not Donald Trump. It was Barack Obama. He appears to have done little to nothing about this Russian penetration of America\u2019s contest for the White House, other than to tell Putin to \u201ccut it out\u201d at a September 2016 meeting in China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, as if to bury the illusory Russia\u2013Trump nexus even further, a February 7 U.S.-led coalition airstrike on pro-Assad \u201cmercenaries\u201d in eastern Syria killed \u201cseveral dozen\u201d Russians, Moscow admitted. Sending Russians home in boxes is hardly what one would expect from Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cpuppet\u201d in Washington, no matter how much Joy Behar and Rachel Maddow huff and puff to the contrary.\n\nIn short, there is not enough proof of Russian collusion by Trump to fuel a stovetop pilot light.\n\nIn contrast, the evidence of Democratic collusion with Russia blazes on, even as Team Mueller ignores it.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s Russian Reset began in Geneva on March 6, 2009. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton huddled with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, and together they pressed a red button that should have been labeled \u201cReset\u201d in Russian. Instead, Hillary\u2019s aides had mislabeled it with the Russian word for \u201cOverload.\u201d Regardless, once pushed, the button symbolized a red dawn of increasingly cozy U.S.\u2013Russian affairs.\n\nObama announced on September 17, 2009, that he would cancel President George W. Bush\u2019s plan to station missile-defense systems in Poland and the Czech Republic. \u201cThis is a U-turn in U.S. policy,\u201d complained former Czech ambassador to Washington Alexander Vondra. \u201cRussia had furiously opposed the project, claiming it targeted Moscow\u2019s nuclear arsenal,\u201d added Luke Harding and Ian Traynor of London\u2019s Guardian. \u201cObama\u2019s climb-down is likely to be seen by Russia as a victory.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Vladimir Putin applauded Obama\u2019s strategic abandonment of the Poles and Czechs. The Russian strongman said: \u201cI do anticipate that this correct and brave decision will be followed by others.\u201d\n\nPutin soon savored more first-class service on the Russian Collusion Express. Barely a month after shafting Poland and the Czech Republic, Team Obama began to ply Putin with planes. To that end, Hillary jetted to Moscow on October 13, 2009.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted that a new Russian airline, Rosavia, is actively considering the acquisition of Boeing aircraft,\u201d Clinton declared at Moscow\u2019s Boeing Design Center. \u201cThe Ex-Im Bank would welcome an application for financing from Rosavia to support its purchase of Boeing aircraft.\u201d Three days later, the Washington Post reports, \u201cBoeing formally submitted its bid for the Russian deal.\u201d\n\nOn June 1, 2010, the Kremlin-owned Rostekhnologii company \u2014 now Rostec \u2014 decided to purchase up to 50 Boeing 737s for Russia\u2019s national airline, Aeroflot. Price: $3.7 billion.\n\nThat August 17, just ten weeks later, Boeing unveiled a $900,000 gift to the Clinton Foundation to \u201chelp support the reconstruction of Haiti\u2019s public education system\u201d after an earthquake had pulverized that destitute island the previous January.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHillary also promoted Skolkovo, an \u201cinnovation city\u201d near Moscow, backed by Kremlin seed rubles worth some $5 billion.\n\n\u201cAt a long meeting I had with [Russia\u2019s then-president Dimitry] Medvedev outside Moscow in October 2009, he raised his plan to build a high-tech corridor in Russia modeled after our own Silicon Valley,\u201d Hillary explained. \u201cI suggested that he visit the original in California,\u201d she added.\n\nHillary\u2019s State Department arranged for 22 leading U.S. venture capitalists to tour Skolkovo in May 2010. Medvedev, in turn, traversed Silicon Valley the next month.\n\nState persuaded Cisco, Google, and Intel, among others, to join Skolkovo. By 2012, the project boasted 28 \u201cKey Partners\u201d in America, Europe, and Russia. Three-fifths of these organizations donated to the Clinton Foundation or paid Bill Clinton speaking fees. From Russia with Money, an August 2016 paper by the Government Accountability Institute, reported that 17 \u201cKey Partners\u201d contributed between $6.5 million and $23.5 million to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nBut by 2013, the U.S. Army Foreign Military Studies Program warned: \u201cSkolkovo is arguably an overt alternative to clandestine industrial espionage.\u201d Boston-based FBI agent Lucia Ziobro concluded in 2014, \u201cThe FBI believes the true motives of the Russian partners, who are often funded by their government, is to gain access to classified, sensitive, and emerging technology from the companies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile visiting Moscow on March 24, 2010, Hillary justified these actions: \u201cOur goal is to help strengthen Russia.\u201d\n\nShe said this to First Channel TV host Vladimir Pozner, a Soviet-era relic who still communicates in barely accented English \u2014 just as he did when he tried to sell Western audiences on the joys of Communism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosatom, the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation, announced plans on June 8, 2010, to buy a 51.4 percent stake in Uranium One \u2014 a Canadian company whose international assets included some 20 percent of America\u2019s reserves of the active ingredient in atomic reactors and nuclear weapons. This $1.3 billion purchase of a strategic-commodity company required the approval of the mysterious Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Hillary was one of nine federal-agency chiefs on CFIUS (pronounced SIPH-ee-us).\n\nThree weeks later, Bill Clinton keynoted a Moscow conference staged by a Kremlin-tied investment bank that promoted Uranium One\u2019s acquisition. Renaissance Capital paid Clinton $500,000 for his one-hour speech that June 29.\n\nCFIUS\u2019s evaluation of Rosatom\u2019s offer, Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer observed, coincided with \u201ca spontaneous outbreak of philanthropy among eight shareholders in Uranium One.\u201d Then-chairman Ian Telfer gave the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative $3.1 million. Founder Frank Giustra gave the Clinton Foundation $131.3 million. Before, during, and after CFIUS\u2019s review, Schweizer calculates, \u201cshareholders involved in this transaction had transferred approximately $145 million to the Clinton Foundation or its initiatives.\u201d\n\nLeading congressional Republicans rebelled.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this potential takeover of U.S. nuclear resources by a Russian government\u2013owned agency would pose great potential harm to the national security of the United States,\u201d Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, then the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote CFIUS\u2019s then-chairman, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. The top Republicans on the Financial Services, Homeland Security, and Armed Services Committees also signed Ros-Lehtinen\u2019s October 5, 2010, letter, which beseeched CFIUS to \u201cblock the sale.\u201d\n\nAs a CFIUS member, the ever-voluble Hillary could have heeded this red alert and stopped Putin from controlling a fifth of U.S. uranium supplies.\n\nNo such luck.\n\nEighteen days after the GOP\u2019s admonition, CFIUS let Rosatom purchase a majority stake in Uranium One. Subsequent investments pushed the Kremlin\u2019s share of Uranium One to 100 percent by January 2013.\n\nSoon after taking total control of Uranium One, Rosatom CEO Sergei Kiriyenko crowed: \u201cFew could have imagined in the past that we would own 20 percent of U.S. reserves.\u201d\n\nObama clearly signaled the Kremlin that the Russian collusion would continue in his second term. At a March 26, 2012, meeting in Seoul, South Korea, an open microphone captured his conversation with Medvedev, which neither knew was being recorded.\n\nObama asked for Russia\u2019s patience, \u201cparticularly with missile defense.\u201d Obama added: \u201cThis is my last election. . . . After my election, I have more flexibility.\u201d\n\nMedvedev replied: \u201cI will transmit this information to Vladimir.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama got Moscow to rescue him from his Syrian \u201cred line\u201d fiasco.\n\nObama boasted in August 2012 that \u201ca red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized.\u201d\n\nOn August 21, 2013, Syrian dictator Bashar Assad struck rebel-controlled Ghouta with sarin nerve gas, killing hundreds of civilians, including boys and girls. The whole world was watching as Obama did nothing, even after Assad clearly poisoned his way across that red line.\n\nThen\u2013secretary of state John Kerry generated titters that September 8 when he said that America might ruffle Assad with \u201cunbelievably small\u201d air strikes. Kerry also said that day in London that Assad should surrender his chemical weapons and \u201callow a full and total accounting for that.\u201d\n\nMoscow loved the concept.\n\n\u201cWithin an hour, an hour and a half,\u201d Kerry said, \u201cI got a phone call from Sergei Lavrov of Russia suggesting that was a really good idea.\u201d\n\nBy mid-September, the U.S. and Russia agreed that Assad would remain untouched, and Syria would sign the Chemical Weapons Convention and yield its toxins.\n\nWhile doves defended this display of diplomacy and disarmament over resolve and force, this policy certainly increased Russia\u2019s global prestige and regional influence. But ultimately this agreement proved hollow when Assad yet again unleashed chemical weapons on his people last April, killing some 100 civilians. In response, President Trump finally enforced Obama\u2019s red line by raining 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles on Shayrat airfield, whence Assad had perpetrated that chemical assault.\n\nRepublican senators Charles Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina drafted a January 4 criminal referral against former British spy Christopher Steele.\n\n\u201cAccording to the law firm Perkins Coie,\u201d Grassley and Graham wrote, in June 2016, \u201cMr. Steele\u2019s dossier-related efforts were funded through Fusion GPS by that law firm on behalf of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton Campaign.\u201d Steele\u2019s work scored him $160,000.\n\nGrassley and Graham note: \u201cOn the face of the dossier, it appears that Mr. Steele gathered much of his information from Russian government sources inside Russia.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The contents of this \u201csalacious and unproven\u201d dossier (in former FBI chief James Comey\u2019s words) wound up triggering a questionable wiretap on former Trump adviser Carter Page and filling newspapers and broadcasts with anti-Trump propaganda.\n\nSo, the relentless, fruitless quest for Russian collusion among Team Trump instead finds it alive and well among Team Clinton \u2014 and as tough to detect as a May Day march through Red Square.\n\nIf Special Counsel Robert Mueller sincerely wishes to expose Russian collusion in general, rather than search in vain for the Republican strain of this virus, he should scrutinize the other side of the aisle. Democrats colluded with Russia from 2009 to at least 2016. If Mueller has no idea where to look, he might start by connecting the nine dots that appear above.", "title": "Russian Collusion: Democrats, Obama, Hillary Clinton"}, {"url": "https://bearingdrift.com/2018/03/22/nuclear-fortress/", "content": "Nuclear Fortress\n\nHow safe are Virginia\u2019s nuclear power plants from terrorists, hackers, and natural disasters? Let\u2019s put it this way: Dominion worries about such threats 24/7 so you don\u2019t have to.\n\nIn addition to interfering in U.S. elections, Vladimir Putin\u2019s busy cyber-servants have been probing information technology weaknesses in U.S. industry and infrastructure. Sophisticated cyber-attacks have been ongoing since at least March 2016. Perhaps most alarming, the Department of Homeland Security asserted last week, Russian hackers gained access to critical control systems at unidentified nuclear power plants.\n\n\u201cWe now have evidence they\u2019re sitting on the machines, connected to industrial control infrastructure, that allow them to effectively turn the power off or effect sabotage, the New York Times quoted Eric Chien, a security technology director at digital-security firm Symantec, as saying. \u201cThey have the ability to shut the power off. All that\u2019s missing is some missing political motivation.\u201d\n\nJournalist Ted Koppel highlighted the vulnerability of the U.S. electric grid to attack in his 2016 book, \u201cLights Out: Cyberattack, a Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath.\u201d Novelists have imagined the horrifying societal collapse following the collapse of the electric grid. As for nuclear plants, the potential for radioactive contamination makes the threat even more terrifying. Fear-inducing scenarios involve terrorist takeovers, the theft of spent radioactive fuel, and jetliners slamming 9/11 style into nuclear reactors.\n\nThe issue of security was top of mind for me when I toured Dominion Energy Virginia\u2019s North Anna Power Station last month. I had the opportunity to pose the kind of questions that members of the public might ask.\n\nI\u2019m not qualified to render judgment on the effectiveness of Dominion\u2019s security efforts, but I can say one thing: Security at the nuclear facility is something the company thinks about around the clock. Utility officials have spent enormous time and effort anticipating and preparing for any scenario you can imagine. Earthquake? Check. Hurricane? Check. Cyber-attack? Check. Armed terrorist attack? Check. Hijacked airplane flying into the nuclear containment dome? Check.\n\nBased on what I learned, I\u2019m not worried about natural disasters or terrorist attacks. The threat of cyber-sabotage continues to unsettle me, but the danger is to the transmission and distribution grid, not to nuclear power plants. Dominion officials assured me \u2014 and for a simple reason that I shall explain in due course, I believe them \u2014 that their nuclear power plant controls are not vulnerable to a cyber-threat.\n\nIf there had never been a Chernobyl or Fukushima, I might not even be asking these questions. As it is, those calamities did occur. We learned that, as thorough as they try to be, nuclear engineers don\u2019t foresee every conceivable contingency. With nation states from Russia and China to Iran and North Korea seeking to penetrate and compromise our infrastructure, we need to keep up our guard. At the same time, we should avoid creating unnecessary alarm. So far, I\u2019ve seen nothing that makes me lose any sleep.\n\nEarthquakes, hurricanes, and aircraft strikes\n\nOn August 23 at 1:51:04 p.m., the control room of the North Anna Power Station began to shake, as if it were sitting on a giant vibrating phone, recalls Lee Baron, who worked in the control room then and now runs the company\u2019s simulation center. Lights on the control board began blinking. Alarms emitted shrill beeping noises. Tiles fell from the ceiling. Outside the facility, some electric transformers cracked.\n\nThe earthquake, the worst trembler to shake the East Coast in at least a century, exceeded what the power station had been designed for, says Baron, but the facility \u201cshrugged it off.\u201d Following Electric Power Research Institute guidelines, the operators powered down the plant without incident. After minor repairs and two months of intensive inspections, the nuclear station was up and running again.\n\nMedia attention focused on the fact that the North Anna station was located on an ancient geologic fault line. The fact that the epicenter of the earthquake was just a few miles away under the town of Mineral led many to conflate the two. But, the two fault lines were unrelated, says Richard Zuercher, manager-nuclear fleet communications for Dominion.\n\nIndeed, as College of William & Mary geologist Chuck Bailey concluded in a 2012 review of maps, photos, and reports, the fault underlying the North Anna Power Station had last been active about 200 million years ago. On the other hand, as the Mineral earthquake demonstrated, the geologic plate upon which the East Coast rests was more active than previously supposed.\n\nUnlike some earthquakes that have a highly localized impact that creates heavy damage, Zuercher says, the Mineral shaker, which registered 5.8 on the Richter scale, diffused its energy and caused light damage over a vast area. The quake was felt as far away as Atlanta and New Brunswick. Virginia does not face a California-like threat of a massive killer quake.\n\nHurricanes and tornadoes are another theoretical threat. The concern is that wind might pick up a cars or telephone poles and hurl them like projectiles. The nuclear reactors, a third of which are underground, are protected by massive containment domes made of compressed concrete lined by steel plate and reinforced by steel rebar.\n\nThe 4 1/2-feet-thick dome wall \u201cis built to take a licking,\u201d says B.E. Standley, the Dominion executive in charge of nuclear power plant safety. \u201cIt can survive anything short of an asteroid strike or zombie apocalypse.\u201d Continue reading ?\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nGoogle\n\nPinterest\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nRelated", "title": "Nuclear Fortress"}, {"url": "https://bigislandnow.com/2018/02/23/hawaii-volcano-watch-slow-slip-event-on-kilauea-volcanos-south-flank-expected-this-year/", "content": "Today\u2019s Volcano Watch begins with a question: Can you guess when the next slow slip event will happen on K\u012blauea Volcano\u2019s South Flank? As a hint, the last one was in October 2015, and before then, events occurred in May 2012, February 2010 and June 2007. If this seems like a pattern, you\u2019re right.\n\nWhat is a \u201cslow slip event\u201d anyway?\n\nSlow slip events are sometimes called \u201cslow earthquakes\u201d or \u201cepisodic slip events.\u201d They happen when a fault begins sliding, just like in a regular earthquake, but so slowly that it takes several days to finish instead of several seconds.\n\nAt K\u012blauea, slow earthquakes occur on the nearly flat-lying d\u00e9collement fault that underlies the volcano\u2019s south flank at a depth of four to five miles. This is the same fault that was responsible for the magnitude-7.7 Kalapana earthquake in 1975.\n\nHowever, slow earthquakes produce no seismic waves and, therefore, none of the damaging shaking of a regular earthquake. Because of this, we actually look forward to them! They help relieve a small amount of stress on the fault and give us a view into frictional properties of this hazardous fault beneath K\u012blauea.\n\nMotion of K\u012blauea\u2019s south flank is recorded by the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory\u2019s GPS (Global Positioning System) monitoring network. These instruments show that the south flank moves steadily seaward about 2.3 inches every year, which is attributed to a phenomenon called \u201cfault creep.\u201d\n\nDuring a slow earthquake, the south flank surges seaward by an additional amount, usually about 1.2 inches. This additional motion occurs over two to three days, and is about the same amount that would happen in a regular magnitude-6 earthquake.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nK\u012blauea slow slip events tend to occur evenly in time; in particular, events after 2005 have occurred every 2.5 years, give or take three months. They are also caused by slip on the same section of the fault every time and tend to be about the same size.\n\nIn fact, K\u012blauea slow slip events are examples of so-called \u201ccharacteristic\u201d earthquakes\u2014a series of several earthquakes of similar magnitude and location, which indicates that they are breaking the exact same part of the fault again and again. According to the \u201ccharacteristic earthquake hypothesis,\u201d this series should continue into the future, allowing scientists to forecast the time, location and size of a future earthquake.\n\nThe characteristic earthquake hypothesis was originally developed in hope that it could predict regular, and possibly damaging, earthquakes. This idea emerged from observations of a series of earthquakes that seemed to strike about every 22 years near the town of Parkfield, California. After earthquakes in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934 and 1966, all of which occurred as magnitude-6 events in the same part of the San Andreas fault, scientists predicted the next earthquake would occur in 1988.\n\nAs it turned out, the next Parkfield earthquake did not occur until 2004, 16 years after the predicted date. However, even though the characteristic earthquake hypothesis wasn\u2019t successful at predicting a regular earthquake, it has been useful for forecasting the occurrence of slow slip events around the world.\n\nLocations where recurring, predictable slow slip events happen include the Cascadia Subduction zone offshore of Washington and Oregon. This fault produces slow slip events equivalent to a magnitude-6.7 earthquake every 15 months. In Japan, on the subduction zone along the Nankai Trough, major slow slip events occur approximately every seven years and are equivalent to magnitude-7 earthquakes!\n\nBecause the most recent slow slip event on K\u012blauea happened in October 2015, and the events have a recurrence time of 2.5 years (give or take three months), we can forecast that the next one might occur between now and August 2018.

On the East Rift Zone, the 61g lava flow remained active downslope of Puu Oo, with scattered breakouts on the pali and coastal plain, but no ocean entry. The 61g flows do not pose an immediate threat to nearby communities.\n\nMauna Loa Volcano is not erupting. A few small-magnitude earthquakes occurred beneath the volcano, primarily on its west flank, at depths ranging from 3-8 miles. Two small earthquakes also occurred near Mauna Loa\u2019s summit at depths less than 3 miles. GPS and InSAR measurements continue to show slow deformation related to inflation of a magma reservoir beneath the summit and upper Southwest Rift Zone. Rates of inflation in the past few months have decreased compared to rates of the past year. It is uncertain if these lower rates will persist or pick up again in the near future. No significant changes in volcanic gas emissions were measured.\n\nOne earthquake with three or more felt reports occurred in Hawaii this past week. At 8:58 p.m. on Feb. 20, a magnitude-3.2 earthquake was recorded 8 miles southwest of Voclano at a depth of 19 miles.\n\nADVERTISING\n\nVisit https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/hvo for past Volcano Watch articles, Kilauea daily eruption updates, Mauna Loa weekly updates, volcano photos, maps, recent earthquakes info, and more.

It hit Lee Merschon on Oct. 10, two days after the North Bay fires began to spread.\n\nMerschon runs an event-planning company in Los Angeles. Sitting at home there, watching reports about the fires on TV, he didn\u2019t understand how bad they were. Then he started getting phone calls from friends in Northern California who camp with him at Burning Man, the annual counterculture gathering in the Nevada desert.\n\n\u201cLee, this is it,\u201d said Jeff Evans, whose home in Napa County was nearly destroyed in a fire years earlier. \u201cThis is what the containers are for.\u201d\n\nThe containers. Every August at Burning Man, 70,000 people convene on a sun-blasted patch of Nevada desert and build a temporary city. Merschon\u2019s piece of Burning Man is Camp Epic, a campsite he founded in 2012. While many Burners eat and sleep in RVs, the 150 inhabitants of Camp Epic live in six heavily modified metal shipping containers. Each is basically a small house: a rectangular prism 40 feet long, like a giant Tetris block, built by a Nevada company called Quick Space that manufactures storage trailers and mobile offices.\n\nThe containers hold up better than RVs in the harsh glare and wind of Burning Man, Merschon says. They have electrical systems, ventilation, beds, shelves, mini-fridges. They don\u2019t have windows, on purpose. \u201cAt Burning Man, you can have 50 mph winds in a sandstorm that looks like \u2018Mad Max,\u2019\u201d he says. But inside a container, \u201cIt seems like everything is normal.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why, even before the wildfires, he\u2019d wondered whether the containers could be called into service in a disaster zone, providing a basic place to live after a hurricane or earthquake.\n\nThen the October wildfires struck, and thousands of homes went up in flames.\n\nThis is what the containers are for.\n\nThe plan formed quickly in Merschon\u2019s mind: People need housing. We have these containers. They\u2019re sitting in storage in Reno. Let\u2019s send them to people who need housing. Let\u2019s send them to the city of Santa Rosa, the center of devastation.\n\nIt felt like a sensible, responsible thing to do. The containers were metal. They couldn\u2019t catch fire like wooden structures. And Quick Space had built them to comply with Nevada\u2019s residential housing code. What could be simpler?\n\n\u201cAt least, that\u2019s what we thought,\u201d Merschon says.\n\nOver the next four months, though, he and dozens of volunteers got a crash course in why it can be so hard to erect housing in California. Santa Rosa officials say that the group had unrealistic expectations. The volunteers say they were obstructed by delays and red tape.\n\n\u201cWe kind of went down a rabbit hole,\u201d says Carmen Mauk, one of the group\u2019s leaders. They couldn\u2019t simply give their gift, they discovered; they had to wait, and wait, and then alter it at great cost, and then wait some more.\n\nThe Burners moved fast. The same day he spoke to Jeff Evans in Napa, Merschon called another camper, Jen Martini, who lived in Santa Rosa. Her mother had lost her house, almost all of her belongings and the family cat in the Tubbs Fire. Martini said she\u2019d go to Reno and prepare the cubes for transport.\n\nMerschon also contacted Mauk, who would become the heart and soul of the project. Mauk, 47, is a former resident of Santa Rosa. The Tubbs Fire had turned the house she used to rent into rubble and ash.\n\nMauk has more than a decade of experience in disaster relief. She got started in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina, when she traveled to the Gulf Coast of Mississippi with about 100 other Burner volunteers. They beat federal relief workers there, and began doing debris removal, tearing down damaged houses. They thought of the work as a gift; at Burning Man, a cashless society, the entire economy runs on gifts.\n\nPhoto: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle The painted 53-foot trailer at Oasis Village, a proposed and...\n\nMauk then founded a nonprofit, Burners Without Borders. Its volunteers went to Peru after an earthquake and built school classrooms and composting toilets. They went to Haiti after its 2010 earthquake. They went to New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.\n\nNow, Mauk was going back to Santa Rosa.\n\nShe knew that people had been struggling to find housing there even before the fires \u2014 only 1 percent of the city\u2019s rental stock was vacant \u2014 and when she heard that almost 9,000 homes and other buildings had been destroyed, she wondered about the fate of working-class people who keep its economy humming: teachers, vineyard laborers, construction workers. How could the region recover if its workers couldn\u2019t find shelter?\n\nMauk and other Burners contacted affordable housing groups. All said that the situation was desperate. They had lists of clients begging for any kind of housing.\n\n\u201cThere were no housing options before,\u201d says Lorena Sotelo, who assists Sonoma County farm workers at California Human Development, a large nonprofit. \u201cNow it\u2019s even worse.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency had yet to arrive. Its first temporary trailers wouldn\u2019t be habitable until Nov. 13, and many in need of shelter would avoid them anyway, fearing deportation, say Sotelo and others who work with undocumented clients. (FEMA has reported low demand; as of January, only 189 of 3,200 people eligible to live in the trailers had asked to do so.)\n\nAcross the region, in parking lots and along the beaches, people were sleeping in cars, in the cold, with no bathrooms, no security. At the Free Store in Healdsburg, a kind of emergency supply depot for shell-shocked families, Ariel Kelley met a family with two young sons sleeping in the back of their truck. When she heard about the shipping-container project, Kelley was excited. Dubbed Oasis Village, it seemed like the fastest way possible to get at least some people into beds.\n\nThe project\u2019s goal was a modest one: provide 76 beds for 76 people for up to nine months. If it worked, it would help 76 people stay in the area who might otherwise have to leave.\n\nMauk and the Burners put out a call for funds and volunteers; 250 people offered manual labor, and $30,000 in donations flowed in. A businessman who owned a cannabis greenhouse in an industrial part of Santa Rosa offered a piece of land. The six shipping containers arrived on Oct. 26, along with a 53-foot trailer that Merschon and his campers had also adapted into a living space. The structures were arranged in a rectangle around a 100-by-50-foot courtyard.\n\nPhoto: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle Oasis Village, in an industrial area of Santa Rosa, never housed...\n\nOn Oct. 31, the Burners applied for a temporary use permit from the city of Santa Rosa. While waiting to hear back, a rotating crew of volunteers spruced up Oasis Village. They put new bedding on the twin and queen beds inside the containers, and added heaters.\n\nThey also set up one of the containers as a kitchen, with donated cookware, and brought in separate trailers with showers and bathrooms. To make the site feel more welcoming, they covered the dirt courtyard with compacted gravel and artificial turf, and erected a semipermanent, heated tent above it, to serve as a communal area.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t luxury living. Still, nonprofit agencies had clients who wanted to move in. The Free Store\u2019s Kelley also heads Corazon Healdsburg, a nonprofit that works to find families affordable housing. Fifteen families told her they were interested; it beat sleeping in their cars.\n\nFrom the Burners\u2019 point of view, Oasis Village was now ready. They weren\u2019t just proposing to build housing; they had built it. Seventy-six temporary units, complete and available. All it needed was the city\u2019s blessing, and people could begin moving in.\n\n\u201cWe here \u2014 any local jurisdiction \u2014 has one set of rules,\u201d says Jesse Oswald, permit intake manager for the Santa Rosa Planning and Economic Development Department. \u201cCalifornia Building Code, Title 24. This is how we build things.\u201d\n\nOswald had no objections to the concept of Oasis Village, he says. He thought it was a creative solution, \u201ca cool project.\u201d But it was his job to make sure Oasis Village met the state building code before he signed any permits. He and his staff had to abide by the code, which is there to ensure the health and safety of residents. And it doesn\u2019t distinguish between emergency temporary housing and any other type. Oasis Village, a cluster of shipping containers, would have to go through the same permit process as a new single-family home in Santa Rosa\u2019s Coffey Park neighborhood, which was destroyed during the fires.\n\nThe Burners didn\u2019t realize this until they started talking to city planners. According to all involved, these were friendly conversations. But the Burners soon found them frustrating. The planners appeared overwhelmed; it often took weeks to get answers to questions. When the answers came, they weren\u2019t what the Burners wanted to hear.\n\nTo obtain permits, the Burners would need to show that the containers met California residential code \u2014 a daunting challenge. The retrofittted containers had been built to Nevada residential code by a company that wasn\u2019t on California\u2019s list of approved providers. From Santa Rosa\u2019s perspective, the containers were black boxes, full of potential liability. Was the wiring safe? Was there unhealthy Chinese drywall on the inside? (There wasn\u2019t.)\n\n\u201cI have no way of knowing how it was even assembled,\u201d says Oswald. \u201cIf I sign on the dotted line, I have to say I\u2019m really comfortable with 70 people living in these things.\u201d\n\nMerschon saw things differently: \u201cEverybody was covering their butts because they didn\u2019t want to get sued later.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle Painted shipping containers at Oasis Village.\n\nIt dawned on the Burners that the city wouldn\u2019t sign off unless expensive alterations were made. The site, they were told, needed access for disabled people. An ADA-compliant shower would cost at least $4,000.\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019re going to have ADA compliance,\u201d Mauk said, \u201cbut not on the first frickin\u2019 day we open. \u2026 Hello, there\u2019s an emergency housing situation here!\u201d\n\nThen there was the issue of windows. The containers didn\u2019t have any. To meet the code, windows would have to be cut into the containers\u2019 doors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s $250 a door,\u201d Mauk says. \u201cThere\u2019s 15 doors. Everything becomes very expensive very quickly.\u201d\n\nOne day, chatting with one of the planners, Mauk started to get \u201ca little riled up\u201d over the windows. Why delay the project for the sake of windows, she asked, when people were out there sleeping in their cars?\n\nAccording to Mauk, the reply came: \u201cWell, cars have windows.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe saw the ridiculousness in it, too,\u201d Mauk says, looking back. \u201cHe was trying to help me understand.\u201d Yes, cars have windows, and they\u2019re built to a standard, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re allowed to come into California.\n\nBy that point, Merschon was done. Done with the city, done with the whole project. When friends asked about it, he changed the subject. He wondered, darkly, if Santa Rosa was putting up roadblocks to Oasis Village because it didn\u2019t care if poor people left the city.\n\nMauk felt differently. She thought the planners wanted the project to happen, but didn\u2019t have the power. \u201cWe were met warmly from the beginning,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that their hands are really tied, having to follow state laws.\u201d\n\nShe sent a letter to Gov. Jerry Brown and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, asking the state to make an emergency declaration \u201cthat will allow for expedited temporary housing.\u201d She received no response from either office.\n\n\u201cThe system is not working,\u201d Mauk says. \u201cNobody is listening.\u201d\n\nOthers were also frustrated. Adrian Chorley, the affordable housing director at California Human Development, visited Oasis Village in December. He was impressed, he says. \u201cAnd the thing is that Carmen has done this before. She has actually set up a project in Haiti \u2014 with none of the problems we had here.\u201d\n\nHe thought Oasis Village looked like an RV park. Maybe not a place for families with young children, but a \u201cperfectly acceptable\u201d place for single adults, perhaps, or for the construction workers pouring into Santa Rosa to rebuild people\u2019s homes but with no place to live themselves.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t believe that the city wouldn\u2019t sign off on the needed permits. \u201cI quite literally stood there and said, \u2018What, are you kidding? They\u2019ve provided housing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs January began, the Burners were out of money, and enthusiasm. They had spent $30,000 to merely transport the containers from Reno and prepare the site. Actually running the project would require another $80,000. They applied for a grant from a fire relief fund administered by the Redwood Credit Union, but the grant was turned down. The credit union said the problem was the project\u2019s lack of permits. Mauk says that in conversations with Redwood, permits were never discussed.\n\nThe Burners guessed that if they tried to find other funding, they might be able to house people by March, at best. The containers had to go back to Nevada by August. Too much time had been lost.\n\nSo, on a warm and sunny Saturday in early February, Oasis Village came down. Mauk and a dozen volunteers stripped the beds, gathered up the kitchenware, and donated the sheets and pots and pans to charity.\n\nIn the months since the fires, the housing crisis in Sonoma County has worsened. One of the largest contractors planning to rebuild homes in Coffey Park, DeNova, announced in January that it was pulling out, saying it was unable to find enough workers. Officials say that 30,000 housing units must be built in the next five years to meet demand.\n\nChorley says that\u2019s unrealistic. \u201cWe\u2019ll be lucky, quite honestly, if we can build 2,000 to 3,000 units in the next five years.\u201d\n\nKelley says it\u2019s \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d that the Burners never got to house people, and thinks government should have been more flexible. \u201cWhen you\u2019re faced with this kind of a disaster, you hope that people are able to think outside the box,\u201d she says. \u201cHealth and safety have to be paramount, but at the same time, there are creative solutions to every problem. You just need to have willing participants who recognize the urgency.\u201d\n\nNonprofit groups say they are hearing from some clients that they can\u2019t make it here. They\u2019re leaving the region. \u201cThey\u2019re going to Texas, Arizona, Las Vegas,\u201d Sotelo says. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything. You know how you feel when you know the need is there and you can\u2019t do anything? I don\u2019t know what to say anymore.\u201d\n\nThe Burners have left, too. They\u2019ll never do another project in California, they say.\n\n\u201cWe showed up,\u201d Merschon says. \u201cWe built a town. It was ready in two weeks. We said, here you go. And they wouldn\u2019t take it. We give them a gift \u2014 how could they not take it?\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m reminded,\u201d he says, \u201cthat the real world doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d", "title": "In wake of Wine Country fires, a burning desire to help goes up in smoke"}, {"url": "http://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2018/03/15/Pedestrian-bridge-collapses-at-university-injuries-unclear/stories/201803150153", "content": "Already have an account?\n\nLogin", "title": "Death toll rises to 6 in collapse of Miami bridge that was built with \u2018innovative\u2019 system"}, {"url": "http://www.vnews.com/Beard-Foundation-names-Jose-Andres-Humanitarian-of-the-Year-following-a-turbulent-year-for-chefs-15851526", "content": "The Washington Post\n\nF ollowing a turbulent year in which chefs from New York to Oakland, Calif., were accused of sexual harassment, the James Beard Foundation announced recently that it would bestow its annual Humanitarian of the Year award on a chef who exhibited far more selfless qualities during 2017: Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, the Washingtonian who led the charge to feed millions of people in Houston, Puerto Rico and Southern California after natural disasters struck those areas.\n\n\u201cJos\u00e9\u2019s work in Puerto Rico and Haiti shows how chefs can use their expertise and unique skills to enact profound change on a global scale,\u201d Mitchell Davis, the foundation\u2019s executive vice president, said in a statement.\n\nAndr\u00e9s will receive the award at the foundation\u2019s May 7 ceremony in Chicago. \u201cHe has demonstrated how, at the most difficult times, hot-cooked meals provide more than nutrition, they provide dignity. Jos\u00e9\u2019s work serves as an important reminder of how precious and nourishing food can be. And we couldn\u2019t imagine a more fitting honoree this year as we celebrate how chefs and our industry \u2018Rise.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe foundation\u2019s \u201cRise\u201d campaign \u2014 which \u201ccelebrates the community of chefs and industry leaders who rise to the occasion\u201d \u2014 is part of its efforts at damage control in an industry that has been rocked by scandals. Among those charged with sexual harassment last year are New Orleans chef and restaurateur John Besh and New York chef and restaurateur Mario Batali, both James Beard Award winners.\n\nA Beard winner himself, Andr\u00e9s rose to the occasion last year with his humanitarian efforts, which often put him at odds with President Donald Trump, who was accused of focusing his attention on other matters as the crisis unfolded in Puerto Rico. (Andr\u00e9s and Trump have, of course, been legal foes, too, after the chef backed out of his lease at the Trump International Hotel in the summer of 2015 when the then-presidential candidate labeled Mexicans as drug dealers and rapists on the campaign trail.)\n\nDuring the latter part of 2017, Andr\u00e9s, the chef and owner behind ThinkFoodGroup, frequently took leave of his daily responsibilities to focus on feeding the hungry with World Central Kitchen, the nonprofit he founded after the massive earthquake in Haiti.\n\nThe chef and nonprofit first mobilized in Houston in late August after Hurricane Harvey turned much of the city into a giant lake. A month later, they were in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, providing millions of hot meals to residents who would have had to survive on MREs and snacks for months if not for Andr\u00e9s and countless volunteers.\n\nLate in 2017, Andr\u00e9s and World Central Kitchen also collaborated with L.A. Kitchen \u2014 founded by Robert Egger, the same man who started D.C. Central Kitchen, an organization that Andres has championed for years \u2014 to help feed displaced residents and firefighters who battled the wildfires in Southern California.\n\nWhen contacted by phone about the Humanitarian of the Year award, Andr\u00e9s, 48, quickly deflected attention away from himself. \u201cI\u2019ve been praised enough,\u201d the chef said. This is something of an understatement: Since focusing his attention on disaster relief, Andr\u00e9s and his work have been covered in depth by many media outlets, including The New York Times, 60 Minutes and The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cWe are all as good as the people around us,\u201d Andr\u00e9s added. \u201cIn my case ... I was in the right moment, in the right place and surrounded by the right people.\u201d\n\nWith women calling out sexual harassers in many industries \u2014 entertainment, politics, media and restaurants, to name a few \u2014 Andr\u00e9s noted that many have called 2017 the year of the woman. He was fast to acknowledge the influences in his own development, including chefs Susan McCreight Lindeborg and Nora Pouillon, who were pioneers in helping to feed the poor and hungry through an innovative Share Our Strength program in the 1990s.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Andr\u00e9s has been honored for his activism. In 2012, Time magazine listed Andr\u00e9s among the 100 Most Influential People in the World. The magazine specifically called out the chef\u2019s activism, including his work for D.C. Central Kitchen, the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves and First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s Let\u2019s Move! campaign. At the time, Andr\u00e9s acknowledged chef-activist Alice Waters as an inspiration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been inspired by so many people,\u201d Andr\u00e9s said last week. People continue to inspire him daily, he added.\n\nWorld Central Kitchen\u2019s work in Puerto Rico has, in fact, inspired Andr\u00e9s to rethink how the nonprofit goes about its business in disaster zones. To date, WCK has served 3.3 million meals in Puerto Rico, most of them prepared by volunteer chefs who work in makeshift kitchens, and the organization continues to have a presence on the island. Volunteers still make more than 6,000 meals a day for residents in areas that have yet to fully recover from the hurricane, Andr\u00e9s said.\n\nBut during a recent trip to the island, Andr\u00e9s and crew started developing new approaches to feed people after natural disasters. One idea includes shipping containers retrofitted into mobile kitchens, which could be moved from place to place within 24 to 48 hours. The nonprofit also wants to help Puerto Ricans grow more of their own food; Andr\u00e9s estimated that nearly 90 percent of the food on the island comes from somewhere else.\n\nThere was other good news for Andr\u00e9s last week. Anthony Bourdain Books/Ecco, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers, announced that it has acquired the North American rights to the story of how Andr\u00e9s, WCK and all those volunteers fed millions on Puerto Rico. The book, We Fed an Island: The True Story of Rebuilding Puerto Rico, One Meal at a Time, will be written by Andr\u00e9s. It\u2019s set for release in September via author and celebrity chef Bourdain\u2019s imprint.\n\n\u201cWith a fraction of the resources available to the government, huge non-profits or NGOs, Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s and World Central Kitchen fed hundreds of thousands of desperate people in Puerto Rico, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria,\u201d Bourdain noted in the announcement. \u201cTheir ingenuity, creativity and fortitude deserve to be recognized, and recorded and replicated as a practical blueprint for how humans can and should best react in the face of disaster. To say that I am proud to publish this book, and to help tell this vital story, is a vast understatement.\u201d\n\nAndr\u00e9s is not prepared to say that his life has taken a turn because of his humanitarian work in Puerto Rico and other disaster areas. He said he could never have predicted what kind of success he would achieve after immigrating to the United States in 1991. He\u2019s not about to predict what the future holds now.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what my life is going to be like in the next five to 10 years,\u201d he said.", "title": "In a Tough Year for Top Chefs, a Humanitarian Restores the Faith"}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2018/03/05/daily-202-democratic-committees-divided-over-playing-in-primaries-with-texas-as-ground-zero/5a9c381430fb047655a06a9d/", "content": "Jim Mathis places a campaign sign near a polling site in San Antonio. The Texas primaries are Tuesday. (Eric Gay/AP)\n\nWith Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve.\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: The first primaries of 2018 in Texas on Tuesday could set the tune for six months of Democratic infighting.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has been taking fire from the left since publishing opposition research on Laura Moser, a progressive candidate in a crowded Democratic primary field to take on Rep. John Culberson (R). The campaign arm for House Democrats concluded that Moser could not win the general election in a suburban Houston district that Hillary Clinton narrowly carried. Among other things, she wrote a piece for Washingtonian magazine in 2014 that said she\u2019d \u201csooner have my teeth pulled out without anesthesia\u201d than move to her grandparents\u2019 home in rural Texas.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez does not think the DCCC should have publicized that information. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d he told me and USA Today\u2019s Susan Page in an interview that aired Sunday for C-SPAN\u2019s \u201cNewsmakers\u201d series. \u201cWe\u2019re at our best as Democrats when we talk about the issues. \u2026 I don\u2019t believe we should be anointing candidates. The people in Texas are the people who should be making the choices in Texas.\u201d\n\nThe public split showcased the diverging priorities of the party committees. The DCCC is willing to play the role of bad cop because leaders think it\u2019s the only way to pick up the 24 seats needed to win the House majority. The DNC, which Perez has now led for a year, is trying to restore trust that was lost in the national party during the contentious 2016 nominating contest between Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cOne thing we\u2019ve learned at the DNC is that when you, in fact or in perception, are trying to put the thumb on the scale in a spirited primary, that can undermine public confidence in us,\u201d said Perez. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve been neutral.\u201d\n\nLaura Moser picks up campaign materials at a print shop in Houston. (Michael Stravato for the Washington Post)\n\nA constellation of liberal groups \u2014 from Justice Democrats and CREDO to the Sanders-aligned Our Revolution \u2014 launched online petitions last week telling DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n to \u201cstop attacking progressives.\u201d\n\nThe DCCC anticipated this blowback. The veteran operatives who work there could have easily placed each of the \u201coppo hits\u201d on Moser in the press with no fingerprints attached. The fact they didn\u2019t was as significant as the underlying content of the message. They were sending a signal about their willingness to wade into crowded primaries and gauging the reaction from the left as they plot strategy for looming primary fights.\n\nThese operatives expect that it will be imperative to intervene in California, where a jungle primary system means that the top two finishers in June will face each other in November, regardless of their party. If there are bunches of Democrats splitting the vote, that could allow two Republicans to make it to the runoff.\n\n\u201cAs we've indicated all cycle, the DCCC is keeping all options on the table to work with our allies and ensure that there's a competitive Democrat on the ballot for voters to elect in November,\u201d Meredith Kelly, the DCCC\u2019s communications director, said on Sunday.\n\nRepublicans are hopeful that record numbers of Democratic primary candidates will lead to squabbling and push the eventual nominees to the left in places like Texas\u2019s Seventh District. The Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC backed by Speaker Paul Ryan, has been looking for opportunities to sow division. On Friday, the group published internal polling that showed Moser gaining since the DCCC\u2019s attacks.\n\nDNC Chairman Tom Perez participates in a Daily 202 Live event last year. (Kristoffer Tripplaar for The Washington Post)\n\nTalking with Democrats over the weekend about the appropriateness of wading into primaries sparked a sense of deja vu because I had almost identical conversations with strategists at the Republican committees and outside groups when they were out of the White House. Republicans blew a lot of winnable races during the Obama years because unelectable candidates prevailed in primaries, from Christine O\u2019Donnell and Sharron Angle in 2010 to Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock in 2012. Allies of Mitch McConnell became more aggressive in 2014, and it helped him become majority leader. On the other hand, going after tea partyers earned the enmity of the base \u2014 and helped lead to disenchantment with the party establishment that allowed for the rise of Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nJust like his Republican counterparts used to, Perez argued that heated primaries make his party stronger. He noted that Ralph Northam won the Virginia governor\u2019s race last November despite facing a credible primary challenge from former congressman Tom Perriello on his left.\n\n\u201cEverybody who went to the polls felt like they had a fair shake, and their candidate had a fair shake,\u201d said Perez. \u201cIt has increased turnout and it has really put wind at our back going into general elections. \u2026 We have to be careful not to confuse unity with unanimity.\u201d (Watch the full half-hour interview here.)\n\nBecause the DNC is staying on the sidelines, the DCCC is becoming a sort of boogeyman on the left. A black Democratic candidate in Pennsylvania last week even accused the committee of trying to nudge him out of the race in favor of white candidates, which the party denied. (Dave Weigel has more on that.)\n\nSigns point to an early voting location in San Antonio. (Eric Gay/AP)\n\n-- Against the backdrop of this intraparty wrangling, there is growing evidence of especially strong Democratic enthusiasm:\n\nFor example, a record number of candidates are running for Congress this year. Paul Kane pulled the numbers for his Sunday column: \u201cBy Dec. 31, 2017, more than 2,100 people had taken at least the first step toward running for the House or Senate by filing the necessary paperwork, according to records kept by the Federal Election Commission. For context, that\u2019s almost twice as many candidates who launched congressional campaigns in 2015. It represents the most candidates at this stage of the election season since the FEC started keeping these records, in 1977. \u2026\n\n\u201cBy Dec. 31, some 1,133 candidates had filed to run as Democrats for House seats, easily the largest crop either party has ever assembled at that point of an election cycle. Even Republicans, with 689 declared candidates for the House in 2017, have their second-largest field ever, trailing only 2009. That massive crop of 745 candidates, the second-largest ever for any party, set the stage for the 2010 midterm wave that delivered Republicans the House majority.\u201d\n\nIn Texas alone, there are 111 House candidates. For the first time in 25 years, at least one Democrat is running in all 36 of the state\u2019s congressional district. In 2016, the party didn\u2019t even field a challenger against eight GOP incumbents. \u201cOn a state legislative level, Democrats have candidates in 132 of the 150 state House districts and in 14 of the 15 state Senate districts up for election this year,\u201d NPR\u2019s Jessica Taylor notes. \u201cThat includes four Senate districts where Democrats didn't field candidates in 2014 or 2012, and 20 new House districts where they didn't have candidates in either 2016, 2014 or 2012.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks largely to a huge surge in Democratic turnout, Texans in the 15 largest counties have smashed the record for early voting in a non-presidential year,\u201d Jonathan Tilove reports in today\u2019s Austin American-Statesman. \u201cWhile there is no necessary correlation between primary and general election turnout, more than twice as many people voted early in the Democratic primaries in 2018 as in 2014, while Republican early voting crept up by 15 percent \u2026 Early voting this year in the Democratic contests was so high in Travis County [which includes Austin] that it slightly exceeded participation in 2016, a presidential year.\u201d\n\nRep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) deplanes from Air Force One with President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama in 2013. (Josh Reynolds/AP)\n\n-- The primary season that begins tomorrow will not wrap up until September, when Massachusetts, Delaware, New Hampshire, New York and Rhode Island vote. (See the full calendar here.)\n\nPurity tests could become a problem during the long stretch between now and then. A story on the front page of today\u2019s New York Times notes that even Rep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) is facing a serious primary challenge from his left in Boston. \u201cMr. Capuano, who is serving his 20th year in Congress, is a down-the-line progressive \u2026 But he has stirred a challenge from Ayanna Pressley, the first black woman elected to the Boston City Council,\u201d Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin report. \u201cIn a district once held by John F. Kennedy and Tip O\u2019Neill, where college campuses abound and minority communities now make up most of the population, Ms. Pressley argues that voters should demand an activist lawmaker who is more than a \u2018reliable vote.\u2019 In an unusual show of deference to Ms. Pressley, two of the state\u2019s highest-profile Democrats, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Seth Moulton, said they would stay neutral rather than back their colleague in Congress. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III \u2026 is behind Mr. Capuano.\u201d\n\nThe 66-year-old incumbent has voted twice to impeach Trump, but he could still lose anyway. \u201cMy district is upset,\u201d Capuano said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like the Donald Trump agenda, and I\u2019ve been as vocal as I can be.\u201d\n\nFolks attend a Republican congressional candidate forum in New Braunfels, Tex. (Eric Gay/AP)\n\n-- But while Democrats face pressure to lurch left, Republicans feel like they must wholeheartedly embrace Trump to win a GOP primary in this environment. Mike DeBonis and Eva Ruth Moravec report on the crowded GOP primaries in Texas: \u201cOne candidate\u2019s campaign signs declare \u2018MAGA,\u2019 referencing Trump\u2019s mantra of \u2018Make America Great Again.\u2019 Another\u2019s is promising to \u2018drain the swamp\u2019 and plays up his ties to a key Trump political adviser. And another\u2019s promises to \u2018Make America Like Texas,\u2019 a slogan spelled out in the Trump campaign\u2019s signature font. \u2026 With some notable exceptions, candidates in one especially raucous Republican primary \u2014 the 18-person contest to fill the 21st District seat being vacated by Rep. Lamar Smith \u2014 have been wary of showing any daylight between their position and Trump\u2019s. \u2018I think if you\u2019re not with the president, you\u2019re not going to have a chance of winning this race,\u2019 said Jason Isaac, a state representative who is running for the seat.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n-- \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d took home Best Picture at an Oscars that was rife with political moments. Dan Zak and Monica Hesse report: \u201c\u2018I think that the greatest thing our art does, and our industry does, is erase the lines in the sand,\u2019 said the winning film\u2019s creator, Guillermo del Toro, whose victory for best director was the fourth time in the past five years that a Mexican filmmaker took home that prize. \u2018We should continue doing that, when the world tells us to make them deeper.\u2019 The industry confronted its own mistreatment of women, and defied the isolationist and nationalist tone set by President Trump, in between doling out golden statuettes \u2014 which went to a wide spectrum of films, including the horror film \u2018Get Out,\u2019 whose writer-director Jordan Peele became the first black filmmaker to win best original screenplay, and the World War II action film \u2018Dunkirk,\u2019 which scooped up three technical awards.\u201d\n\nThere were many references to the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements: \u201c[Best Actress winner Frances McDormand] asked all the female nominees in the audience to stand. \u2018Okay, look around everybody, look around ladies and gentlemen,\u2019 McDormand said to a cheering audience. \u2018Because we all have stories to tell and projects we need financed. Don\u2019t talk to us about it at the parties tonight; invite us into your office in a couple days.\u2019 Nearly two and a half hours into the ceremony, three women who\u2019ve accused Weinstein of sexual abuse took the stage: Salma Hayek Pinault, Ashley Judd and Annabella Sciorra.\u201d\n\nHere is the complete list of winners.\n\n-- Host Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s jokes nodded to Hollywood\u2019s sexual misconduct scandals, Trump and Fox News. Kimmel said of the Oscars\u2019 90th anniversary, \u201cOscar is 90 years old tonight, which means he\u2019s probably at home right now watching Fox News.\u201d (Emily Yahr)\n\n-- \u201cPerhaps the most palpable presence at the ceremony was its most conspicuous absence: Harvey Weinstein,\u201d writes Ann Hornaday. \u201cGloria Steinem used to say before we had terms like sexual harassment and domestic violence, those things \u2018were just called life.\u2019 As heartening as it was to see Hollywood celebrating a wider array of voices and visions, real progress will come when that doesn\u2019t come under headings of \u2018inclusion\u2019 or \u2018diversity,\u2019 but will just be called the movies.\u201d\n\nActivists with Casapound, a far-right movement turned political party, wave flags during a rally at the Pantheon square in Rome. (Andreas Solaro/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n-- Siren from Rome: The populist contagion has infected Italy. \u201cItalian populists of all leanings took a hammer to their country\u2019s old political order in Sunday elections, crushing traditional centrist parties in favor of a kaleidoscope of alternatives on the left and right and upending their former system,\u201d Michael Birnbaum reports from Rome. \u201cThe vote plunged Europe\u2019s fourth-largest economy into an uncertainty unique even to a nation known for cycling through leaders at a rapid clip. The shattering of the political landscape ruled out most plausible alliances among parties. But voters did not offer a clear direction for the future as they struggle with a stagnating economy and an influx of migrants, even as more than half voted for anti-establishment parties.\n\n\u201cThe surging outsider Five Star Movement captured more voters than any other party, about 32 percent, according to projections based on initial vote counts, meaning it is likely to play a key role in any governing coalition. In an extraordinary result, it appeared to have won nearly as many votes as the mainstream center-left and center-right parties combined. Italy\u2019s complicated electoral system could lead to initial results shifting slightly, but politicians of all stripes were treating the first projections as an earthquake.\n\n\u201cThe election drew the attention of anti-establishment crusaders from around the world, who saw the roiling populist energy of the campaign as a harbinger for other European nations. \u2026 Stephen K. Bannon was among the people who traveled to Rome to see the final days of the campaign. Formerly fringe ideas, such as deporting 600,000 migrants who have come to Italy without proper papers in recent years, have entered the mainstream.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cThe contours of the new regime are still unclear, but an old one is certainly passing,\u201d Ishaan Tharoor writes in his WorldViews newsletter. \u201cIn the weeks ahead, Italy's populists and ultranationalists will have to reckon with the actual prospect of taking power.\u201d\n\nGET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b\n\nThe nor\u2019easter that pounded the East Coast over the past few days claimed eight lives.

Jon Tester (Mont.) and Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), seen here with President Trump last year, support rolling back Dodd-Frank. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nTHE DECONSTRUCTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE:\n\n-- \u201cThe Senate is preparing to scale back the sweeping banking regulations passed after the 2008 financial crisis, with more than a dozen Democrats ready to give Republicans the votes they need to weaken one of President Barack Obama\u2019s largest legislative achievements,\u201d Erica Werner and Damian Paletta report. \u201cCongress\u2019s appetite for pulling back bank regulations shows the renewed clout of the financial sector in Washington, not just in the GOP but also among Democrats. Eight years after nearly every Senate Democrat backed a sweeping set of new rules for financial firms large and small, the party is now split, with moderates, several of them facing tough midterm election contests, working with the opposing party.\n\n\u201cThe core of the new bill exempts about two dozen financial companies with assets between $50 billion and $250 billion from the highest levels of scrutiny by the Federal Reserve \u2026 Supporters argue that the legislation would bring much-needed relief to midsize and regional banks that were treated like their much larger counterparts under the 2010 legislation known as Dodd-Frank. Opponents say it would weaken the oversight needed to stave off the type of dangerous lending and investing that brought the U.S. economy to its knees. The Senate is slated to take an initial procedural vote this week to move the measure forward, and if it eventually becomes law [as expected], it would be the most substantial weakening of Dodd-Frank since it was passed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the 10th anniversary of an enormous financial crash, Congress should not be passing laws to roll back regulations on Wall Street banks,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). \u201cThe bill permits about 25 of the 40 largest banks in America to escape heightened scrutiny and to be regulated as if they were tiny little community banks that could have no impact on the economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), a Banking Committee member and one of the new bill\u2019s leading Democratic supporters, said banks in his largely rural state have been going out of business in part because of the regulations imposed by Dodd-Frank. \u2026 Financial firms upped their campaign contributions to key Senate Democrats over the last year, with [Heidi] Heitkamp, [Joe] Donnelly and Tester becoming the top three Senate recipients of donations from commercial banks so far in the 2018 campaign cycle \u2026 Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who represents Wall Street and is often motivated by the desire to protect his vulnerable red-state incumbents, opposes the bill, but he has taken a largely hands-off approach to the debate thus far.\u201d\n\nThe offices of a shuttered coal operation are abandoned in Hi Hat, Ky. The Appalachian Regional Commission helps areas like this. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nA WINDOW INTO HOW WASHINGTON WORKS:\n\n-- Boston Globe A1, \u201cZombie agencies are nearly impossible to kill,\u201d by Annie Linskey: \u201cShortly after taking office, (Trump) identified 19 little-known federal offices for elimination. But despite his efforts to do away with what he sees as government waste, the bureaus are all still living, breathing, and spending taxpayer dollars. \u2026 From regional development commissions to arts councils, to offices responsible for fostering foreign aid, all these bureaus have continued their work ...\n\n\u201cA case study of sorts in bureaucratic survival is illustrated by the Appalachian Regional Commission, one of the agencies Trump initially wanted to get rid of last year. This roughly $150 million program might seem like an obvious place to slice. \u2026 As it turns out, the Appalachian Regional Commission has a lot going for it that might not be apparent at first glance. It crosses 13 state boundaries. In Washington math, that means 26 senators have a reason to care about it. (Twenty-three of those 26 senators voted to keep it alive, including 15 Republicans.) One of states served by the commission is Kentucky, which is home to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. In January Trump nominated one of McConnell\u2019s top staffers, Tim Thomas, to be the federal cochairman of the commission. This year, Trump didn\u2019t suggest eliminating the agency. It\u2019s off the kill list.\u201d\n\nTHE REST OF TRUMP'S AGENDA:\n\n-- \u201cTrump says American workers are hurt by immigration. But after ICE raided this Texas town, they never showed up,\u201d by Nick Miroff: \u201cIn deep-red Moore County, where Trump won 75 percent of the vote, the president\u2019s rhetoric on immigration has emboldened some of his supporters to freely vent their frustrations at the meatpacking plant they blame for bringing crime, drugs and civic decline. Their corner of northern Texas has been culturally and economically transformed, and they had never had an American president say the transformation was a bad thing. And yet, no one seemed to believe the Cactus plant would be filled anytime soon with American workers. People here were not even sure they were American jobs in the first place. At least not since the Vietnamese and Laotians showed up in the late 1970s, a few years after the plant opened.\u201d\n\n-- Administration officials sent mixed signals about the president\u2019s aluminum and steel tariffs on the Sunday shows. From Anne Gearan and Karoun Demirjian: \u201cWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro appeared to draw a firm line against case-by-case exemptions as he defended President Trump's sudden imposition of new trade premiums, which are likely to hit Canada and Europe hardest. \u2026 \u2018As soon as he starts exempting countries, he has to raise the tariff on everybody else,\u2019 the adviser said [on Fox News] when asked about Canada and the European Union. \u2026 In a separate interview on CNN, Navarro suggested Trump could indeed grant exceptions if doing so would serve U.S. interests. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that although he does not expect Trump to change his mind, he does not rule it out.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s constantly shifting policy positions have left congressional Republicans feeling directionless. John Wagner and Seung Min Kim report: \u201cThe legislative standoffs on guns and immigration have also underscored a larger reality about Trump\u2019s relationship with Capitol Hill: ... He has been unable to score a major legislative victory on any issue that was not already a leading priority of Republican lawmakers. \u2026 Trump\u2019s policy inconsistencies are sure to complicate and even stymie whatever legislative agenda he has this year, leaving a vacuum of policy details that lawmakers then attempt to fill.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson attends the Ministerial Meeting of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS in Kuwait City, Kuwait.

Tillerson in his department\u2019s ability to execute its historically wide-ranging mission and spend its money wisely. Mr. Tillerson has voiced skepticism that the United States is even capable of doing anything to counter the Russian threat.\u201d\n\n-- The State Department\u2019s 2019 budget calls for slashing funds for the National Endowment for Democracy, reports Josh Rogin. \u201c[The budget would also] disassemble [NED\u2019s] relationships with its core institutes, including the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute. For the NED and those institutes, the proposal is an assault not only on their organizations but also on the pro-democracy mission they are dedicated to. \u2026 The proposal initially came out of the Office of Management and Budget, even though the State Department did not formally ask for it. A senior OMB official told me the administration supports the NED\u2019s mission but wants to consolidate the funding streams to improve oversight and accountability. But the White House didn\u2019t provide any evidence that the current model is inefficient.\u201d\n\n-- In a closed-door speech, Trump praised China for ditching presidential term limits. From Amanda Erickson: \u201c[While speaking to Republican donors at Mar-a-Lago] on Saturday, Trump joked about the term-limits move, saying Xi is now \u2018president for life. President for life. No, he's great. And, look, he was able to do that. I think it's great.\u2019 \u2018Maybe we'll have to give that a shot someday,\u2019 Trump went on.\u201d\n\n-- Obama\u2019s former chief of staff Denis McDonough blamed Mitch McConnell for watering down language about Russian election interference in a letter to states about protecting their voting systems. From Karoun Demirjian: \u201cMcDonough complained on NBC\u2019s [\u2018Meet the Press\u2019] that members of Congress have shown a \u2018stunning lack of urgency about this question,\u2019 and he put the blame mostly on Republican leaders in Congress. \u2018The lack of urgency that we saw from the Republican leadership in 2016, we continue to see to this day today,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s beyond time for Congress to work with the administration, to work with the states, to ensure that our electoral systems are ready to go.

From Karoun Demirjian: \u201c\u2018He can set his legacy: President Trump coming forth to something like this and putting his support behind will give Republicans enough cover to support this,\u2019 said Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.)[.] \u2026 But the senator cautioned against adding a provision to ban semiautomatic weapons, such as the AR-15, to that bill. \u2026 Manchin also endorsed a new effort from Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) that would let police or relatives of an individual who shows \u2018red flags\u2019 to petition the court to seize that person\u2019s firearms. \u2026 \u2018The president did a good job talking about \u2014 we should be able to do something to stop shootings like this,\u2019 Graham said.\u201d\n\n-- Senators facing tough reelections have been conspicuously silent in the gun debate. From the AP\u2019s Steve Peoples. \u201cThey often choose strategic silence rather than get crosswise with the National Rifle Association\u2019s die-hard supporters on the right or the growing movement of passionate gun control advocates on the left. The office of Nevada\u2019s senior senator, Republican Dean Heller, would not say why did he did not attend the White House meeting. Heller \u2026 has avoided the spotlight in the subsequent days as well, declining to address specifics about his positions on gun legislation. \u2026 North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly, both Democrats running for reelection in states Trump won handily, have said nothing about gun violence from the Senate floor in recent days, but made statements honoring constituents who had recently passed away.\u201d\n\n-- A gun show in a conservative Chicago suburb banned sales of AR-15s. Mark Guarino reports: \u201cOrganizers halted an advertised raffle that would have awarded an AR-15 to the winner, and vendors were told they would not be allowed to sell the weapon at the monthly show. Frank Cesare \u2014 of the Pioneer Valley Sportsman\u2019s Association, which has hosted the show for more than 40 years \u2014 said the decision followed complaints the group received after the Parkland shooting and as gun-control advocates planned to protest. \u2026 Cesare said that the ban on AR-15s also would remain in place for April\u2019s show and that the club is \u2018waiting to see\u2019 what the mood is like before deciding on shows later in the year.\u201d\n\n-- Former Ohio attorney general Marc Dann (D) wrote an op-ed for the Cleveland Plain Dealer entitled, \u201cWhy I regret being in the pocket of the NRA:\u201d \u201cUnlike other special interests that exert influence by making campaign contributions, the gun groups spend the blood money they collect from gunmakers to misinform and then motivate voters who care about a single issue: the sanctity of the Second Amendment. \u2026 Anyone who thinks Social Security is the third rail of American politics has clearly never talked about firearms with an NRA member. While I didn't enter politics to be an advocate for the NRA, I quickly learned that unless I became one, I wouldn't be around to advocate for the issues I did care about. So I made a devil's bargain with myself: To stay in office, I adopted pro-gun positions that made me uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nThe president, accompanied by the first lady, waves to members of the media as they arrive Saturday at Andrews Air Force Base.

From Politico\u2019s Nancy Cook and Andrew Restuccia. \u201c[A]s president, he rarely comes into contact with regular people except in the structured setting of the White House or during tightly orchestrated events set up by staff[.] \u2026 It\u2019s another way that Trump has obliterated the norms of the presidency, according to interviews with more than 20 current and former White House officials, Trump friends and close advisers. Rather than trying to project an air of accessibility, Trump has unapologetically stuck to his insular White House life, avoiding and more or less eliminating the optics of the president appearing in public as a citizen. The approach keeps Trump in his comfort zone but makes it harder for him to do the work of being president[.]\u201d\n\n-- HUD Secretary Ben Carson reportedly considered quitting amid recent budget battles. The New York Times\u2019s Glenn Thrush reports: \u201c\u2018There are more complexities here than in brain surgery,\u2019 Mr. Carson said in an interview last week. \u2018Doing this job is going to be a very intricate process.\u2019 \u2026 While Mr. Trump treats him with respect, he views him as a beta \u2018winner,\u2019 not as a \u2018killer,\u2019 the alpha in his organizational taxonomy, according to several White House officials. That lack of influence was painfully apparent during the internal debate before the release of Mr. Trump\u2019s budget, which would help pay for increases in military and Homeland Security spending with steep cuts to HUD\u2019s Community Development Block Grant and core housing programs. \u2026 In private, \u2026 Mr. Carson has been profoundly frustrated, telling friends he would find it difficult to stay if deep cuts to two housing programs, focused on helping the elderly and the disabled, were enacted.\u201d\n\n-- As other high-profile Trump advisers have left exited, Kellyanne Conway has managed to hold on. The New York Times\u2019s Katie Rogers and Maggie Haberman write: \u201cIn a White House with the highest turnover rates in decades, she has survived by knowing when to step back from the spotlight, keeping the president\u2019s ear, focusing on a policy issue significant to the poor and working class, and maintaining an unflinching loyalty to President Trump even as she outmaneuvers rivals on the staff.

Ben Guarino and Laurie McGinley report: \u201cNamed for the first three digits of pi, 314 Action describes itself as the vanguard of \u2018the pro-science resistance.\u2019 The group\u2019s founder, Shaughnessy Naughton, said 7,000 people have responded to the group\u2019s call to run for office. The group has also assembled a network of about 400,000 donors eager to support candidates who back science-based policies. While a few scientist-candidates are running as independents, most are Democrats making their first foray into party politics. (More than 80 percent of scientists in a 2014 Pew survey identified as Democrats or Democrat-leaning.) 314 Action is working with 30 congressional candidates across the country and expects to formally endorse about half that number.\u201d\n\n-- The National Journal\u2019s Josh Kraushaar argues that, if Republicans lose the special election in Pennsylvania, it will be \u201can unmistakable verdict that the healthy economy and Trump tax cuts will be overshadowed by the administration\u2019s dysfunction and roiling suburban anger.\u201d \u201cEven a close loss in such a reliably conservative area would raise red flags that Democrats are on the verge of a major landslide in the November midterms. \u2026 Though the economy may play to the GOP\u2019s advantage, the culture wars have turned squarely in the Democratic Party\u2019s favor \u2014 and that\u2019s what matters in today\u2019s politics. \u2026 Republicans are eager to pin a disappointing result in this election on their candidate \u2014 state Rep.

It hit Lee Merschon on Oct. 10, two days after the North Bay fires began to spread.\n\nMerschon runs an event-planning company in Los Angeles. Sitting at home there, watching reports about the fires on TV, he didn\u2019t understand how bad they were. Then he started getting phone calls from friends in Northern California who camp with him at Burning Man, the annual counterculture gathering in the Nevada desert.\n\n\u201cLee, this is it,\u201d said Jeff Evans, whose home in Napa County was nearly destroyed in a fire years earlier. \u201cThis is what the containers are for.\u201d\n\nThe containers. Every August at Burning Man, 70,000 people convene on a sun-blasted patch of Nevada desert and build a temporary city. Merschon\u2019s piece of Burning Man is Camp Epic, a campsite he founded in 2012. While many Burners eat and sleep in RVs, the 150 inhabitants of Camp Epic live in six heavily modified metal shipping containers. Each is basically a small house: a rectangular prism 40 feet long, like a giant Tetris block, built by a Nevada company called Quick Space that manufactures storage trailers and mobile offices.\n\nThe containers hold up better than RVs in the harsh glare and wind of Burning Man, Merschon says. They have electrical systems, ventilation, beds, shelves, mini-fridges. They don\u2019t have windows, on purpose. \u201cAt Burning Man, you can have 50 mph winds in a sandstorm that looks like \u2018Mad Max,\u2019\u201d he says. But inside a container, \u201cIt seems like everything is normal.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why, even before the wildfires, he\u2019d wondered whether the containers could be called into service in a disaster zone, providing a basic place to live after a hurricane or earthquake.\n\nThen the October wildfires struck, and thousands of homes went up in flames.\n\nThis is what the containers are for.\n\nThe plan formed quickly in Merschon\u2019s mind: People need housing. We have these containers. They\u2019re sitting in storage in Reno. Let\u2019s send them to people who need housing. Let\u2019s send them to the city of Santa Rosa, the center of devastation.\n\nIt felt like a sensible, responsible thing to do. The containers were metal. They couldn\u2019t catch fire like wooden structures. And Quick Space had built them to comply with Nevada\u2019s residential housing code. What could be simpler?\n\n\u201cAt least, that\u2019s what we thought,\u201d Merschon says.\n\nOver the next four months, though, he and dozens of volunteers got a crash course in why it can be so hard to erect housing in California. Santa Rosa officials say that the group had unrealistic expectations. The volunteers say they were obstructed by delays and red tape.\n\n\u201cWe kind of went down a rabbit hole,\u201d says Carmen Mauk, one of the group\u2019s leaders. They couldn\u2019t simply give their gift, they discovered; they had to wait, and wait, and then alter it at great cost, and then wait some more.\n\nThe Burners moved fast. The same day he spoke to Jeff Evans in Napa, Merschon called another camper, Jen Martini, who lived in Santa Rosa. Her mother had lost her house, almost all of her belongings and the family cat in the Tubbs Fire. Martini said she\u2019d go to Reno and prepare the cubes for transport.\n\nMerschon also contacted Mauk, who would become the heart and soul of the project. Mauk, 47, is a former resident of Santa Rosa. The Tubbs Fire had turned the house she used to rent into rubble and ash.\n\nMauk has more than a decade of experience in disaster relief. She got started in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina, when she traveled to the Gulf Coast of Mississippi with about 100 other Burner volunteers. They beat federal relief workers there, and began doing debris removal, tearing down damaged houses. They thought of the work as a gift; at Burning Man, a cashless society, the entire economy runs on gifts.\n\nPhoto: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle The painted 53-foot trailer at Oasis Village, a proposed and...\n\nMauk then founded a nonprofit, Burners Without Borders. Its volunteers went to Peru after an earthquake and built school classrooms and composting toilets. They went to Haiti after its 2010 earthquake. They went to New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.\n\nNow, Mauk was going back to Santa Rosa.\n\nShe knew that people had been struggling to find housing there even before the fires \u2014 only 1 percent of the city\u2019s rental stock was vacant \u2014 and when she heard that almost 9,000 homes and other buildings had been destroyed, she wondered about the fate of working-class people who keep its economy humming: teachers, vineyard laborers, construction workers. How could the region recover if its workers couldn\u2019t find shelter?\n\nMauk and other Burners contacted affordable housing groups. All said that the situation was desperate. They had lists of clients begging for any kind of housing.\n\n\u201cThere were no housing options before,\u201d says Lorena Sotelo, who assists Sonoma County farm workers at California Human Development, a large nonprofit. \u201cNow it\u2019s even worse.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency had yet to arrive. Its first temporary trailers wouldn\u2019t be habitable until Nov. 13, and many in need of shelter would avoid them anyway, fearing deportation, say Sotelo and others who work with undocumented clients. (FEMA has reported low demand; as of January, only 189 of 3,200 people eligible to live in the trailers had asked to do so.)\n\nAcross the region, in parking lots and along the beaches, people were sleeping in cars, in the cold, with no bathrooms, no security. At the Free Store in Healdsburg, a kind of emergency supply depot for shell-shocked families, Ariel Kelley met a family with two young sons sleeping in the back of their truck. When she heard about the shipping-container project, Kelley was excited. Dubbed Oasis Village, it seemed like the fastest way possible to get at least some people into beds.\n\nThe project\u2019s goal was a modest one: provide 76 beds for 76 people for up to nine months. If it worked, it would help 76 people stay in the area who might otherwise have to leave.\n\nMauk and the Burners put out a call for funds and volunteers; 250 people offered manual labor, and $30,000 in donations flowed in. A businessman who owned a cannabis greenhouse in an industrial part of Santa Rosa offered a piece of land. The six shipping containers arrived on Oct. 26, along with a 53-foot trailer that Merschon and his campers had also adapted into a living space. The structures were arranged in a rectangle around a 100-by-50-foot courtyard.\n\nPhoto: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle Oasis Village, in an industrial area of Santa Rosa, never housed...\n\nOn Oct. 31, the Burners applied for a temporary use permit from the city of Santa Rosa. While waiting to hear back, a rotating crew of volunteers spruced up Oasis Village. They put new bedding on the twin and queen beds inside the containers, and added heaters.\n\nThey also set up one of the containers as a kitchen, with donated cookware, and brought in separate trailers with showers and bathrooms. To make the site feel more welcoming, they covered the dirt courtyard with compacted gravel and artificial turf, and erected a semipermanent, heated tent above it, to serve as a communal area.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t luxury living. Still, nonprofit agencies had clients who wanted to move in. The Free Store\u2019s Kelley also heads Corazon Healdsburg, a nonprofit that works to find families affordable housing. Fifteen families told her they were interested; it beat sleeping in their cars.\n\nFrom the Burners\u2019 point of view, Oasis Village was now ready. They weren\u2019t just proposing to build housing; they had built it. Seventy-six temporary units, complete and available. All it needed was the city\u2019s blessing, and people could begin moving in.\n\n\u201cWe here \u2014 any local jurisdiction \u2014 has one set of rules,\u201d says Jesse Oswald, permit intake manager for the Santa Rosa Planning and Economic Development Department. \u201cCalifornia Building Code, Title 24. This is how we build things.\u201d\n\nOswald had no objections to the concept of Oasis Village, he says. He thought it was a creative solution, \u201ca cool project.\u201d But it was his job to make sure Oasis Village met the state building code before he signed any permits. He and his staff had to abide by the code, which is there to ensure the health and safety of residents. And it doesn\u2019t distinguish between emergency temporary housing and any other type. Oasis Village, a cluster of shipping containers, would have to go through the same permit process as a new single-family home in Santa Rosa\u2019s Coffey Park neighborhood, which was destroyed during the fires.\n\nThe Burners didn\u2019t realize this until they started talking to city planners. According to all involved, these were friendly conversations. But the Burners soon found them frustrating. The planners appeared overwhelmed; it often took weeks to get answers to questions. When the answers came, they weren\u2019t what the Burners wanted to hear.\n\nTo obtain permits, the Burners would need to show that the containers met California residential code \u2014 a daunting challenge. The retrofittted containers had been built to Nevada residential code by a company that wasn\u2019t on California\u2019s list of approved providers. From Santa Rosa\u2019s perspective, the containers were black boxes, full of potential liability. Was the wiring safe? Was there unhealthy Chinese drywall on the inside? (There wasn\u2019t.)\n\n\u201cI have no way of knowing how it was even assembled,\u201d says Oswald. \u201cIf I sign on the dotted line, I have to say I\u2019m really comfortable with 70 people living in these things.\u201d\n\nMerschon saw things differently: \u201cEverybody was covering their butts because they didn\u2019t want to get sued later.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle Painted shipping containers at Oasis Village.\n\nIt dawned on the Burners that the city wouldn\u2019t sign off unless expensive alterations were made. The site, they were told, needed access for disabled people. An ADA-compliant shower would cost at least $4,000.\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019re going to have ADA compliance,\u201d Mauk said, \u201cbut not on the first frickin\u2019 day we open. \u2026 Hello, there\u2019s an emergency housing situation here!\u201d\n\nThen there was the issue of windows. The containers didn\u2019t have any. To meet the code, windows would have to be cut into the containers\u2019 doors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s $250 a door,\u201d Mauk says. \u201cThere\u2019s 15 doors. Everything becomes very expensive very quickly.\u201d\n\nOne day, chatting with one of the planners, Mauk started to get \u201ca little riled up\u201d over the windows. Why delay the project for the sake of windows, she asked, when people were out there sleeping in their cars?\n\nAccording to Mauk, the reply came: \u201cWell, cars have windows.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe saw the ridiculousness in it, too,\u201d Mauk says, looking back. \u201cHe was trying to help me understand.\u201d Yes, cars have windows, and they\u2019re built to a standard, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re allowed to come into California.\n\nBy that point, Merschon was done. Done with the city, done with the whole project. When friends asked about it, he changed the subject. He wondered, darkly, if Santa Rosa was putting up roadblocks to Oasis Village because it didn\u2019t care if poor people left the city.\n\nMauk felt differently. She thought the planners wanted the project to happen, but didn\u2019t have the power. \u201cWe were met warmly from the beginning,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that their hands are really tied, having to follow state laws.\u201d\n\nShe sent a letter to Gov. Jerry Brown and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, asking the state to make an emergency declaration \u201cthat will allow for expedited temporary housing.\u201d She received no response from either office.\n\n\u201cThe system is not working,\u201d Mauk says. \u201cNobody is listening.\u201d\n\nOthers were also frustrated. Adrian Chorley, the affordable housing director at California Human Development, visited Oasis Village in December. He was impressed, he says. \u201cAnd the thing is that Carmen has done this before. She has actually set up a project in Haiti \u2014 with none of the problems we had here.\u201d\n\nHe thought Oasis Village looked like an RV park. Maybe not a place for families with young children, but a \u201cperfectly acceptable\u201d place for single adults, perhaps, or for the construction workers pouring into Santa Rosa to rebuild people\u2019s homes but with no place to live themselves.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t believe that the city wouldn\u2019t sign off on the needed permits. \u201cI quite literally stood there and said, \u2018What, are you kidding? They\u2019ve provided housing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs January began, the Burners were out of money, and enthusiasm. They had spent $30,000 to merely transport the containers from Reno and prepare the site. Actually running the project would require another $80,000. They applied for a grant from a fire relief fund administered by the Redwood Credit Union, but the grant was turned down. The credit union said the problem was the project\u2019s lack of permits. Mauk says that in conversations with Redwood, permits were never discussed.\n\nThe Burners guessed that if they tried to find other funding, they might be able to house people by March, at best. The containers had to go back to Nevada by August. Too much time had been lost.\n\nSo, on a warm and sunny Saturday in early February, Oasis Village came down. Mauk and a dozen volunteers stripped the beds, gathered up the kitchenware, and donated the sheets and pots and pans to charity.\n\nIn the months since the fires, the housing crisis in Sonoma County has worsened. One of the largest contractors planning to rebuild homes in Coffey Park, DeNova, announced in January that it was pulling out, saying it was unable to find enough workers. Officials say that 30,000 housing units must be built in the next five years to meet demand.\n\nChorley says that\u2019s unrealistic. \u201cWe\u2019ll be lucky, quite honestly, if we can build 2,000 to 3,000 units in the next five years.\u201d\n\nKelley says it\u2019s \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d that the Burners never got to house people, and thinks government should have been more flexible. \u201cWhen you\u2019re faced with this kind of a disaster, you hope that people are able to think outside the box,\u201d she says. \u201cHealth and safety have to be paramount, but at the same time, there are creative solutions to every problem. You just need to have willing participants who recognize the urgency.\u201d\n\nNonprofit groups say they are hearing from some clients that they can\u2019t make it here. They\u2019re leaving the region. \u201cThey\u2019re going to Texas, Arizona, Las Vegas,\u201d Sotelo says. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything. You know how you feel when you know the need is there and you can\u2019t do anything? I don\u2019t know what to say anymore.\u201d\n\nThe Burners have left, too. They\u2019ll never do another project in California, they say.\n\n\u201cWe showed up,\u201d Merschon says. \u201cWe built a town. It was ready in two weeks. We said, here you go. And they wouldn\u2019t take it. We give them a gift \u2014 how could they not take it?\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m reminded,\u201d he says, \u201cthat the real world doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d", "title": "In wake of Wine Country fires, a burning desire to help goes up in smoke"}, {"url": "http://www.bravotv.com/the-feast/travel-to-california-wine-country-after-the-fires", "content": "California's historic wildfires took a devastating toll last year. Apart from the horror of the lives and structures lost, there was the impact on livelihoods within California\u2019s most famous wine-producing regions. So, what is California wine country like after the fires?\n\nFirst, Northern California\u2019s beloved Napa and Sonoma counties seemed ruined, and then Montecito and Ojai took a staggering hit. Luckily for Paso Robles, also a big producer, the area had no natural disasters to contend with. (There visitors can now ride horses at Halter Ranch Winery, take an Art & Wine Tour at Allegretto Vineyard Resort, and sip along the Paso Robles Distillery Trail.)\n\nBut like in the Caribbean after last fall\u2019s hurricanes, the aftermath of these terrible natural disasters is incredibly confusing to those who are not in it or witnessing the destruction firsthand. In the Caribbean, there were many entire islands that suffered zero damage, not even a palm tree lost \u2014 and likewise, in a great deal of the wine country, there is little evidence of the fires. In fact, of around 900 wineries in both Napa and Sonoma, only 20 suffered significant damage. So now is not the time to take a wine trip off your 2018 travel itinerary \u2014 rather, it\u2019s actually more of a reason to go now and support the many unaffected businesses that rely on tourism to survive.\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nAs was the problem down south, wind was the major factor in Northern California's October fires, which caused some homes to be completely burnt to a crisp while places across the street were left untouched (an estimated 5,700 structures were destroyed).\n\nBut as tragic as it was for locals, hotels, restaurants, and the majority of wineries in both Napa and Sonoma are open for business \u2014 Signorello Estate and Paradise Ridge Winery were the two that were completely destroyed. Some vineyard blocks burned and will have to be replanted, but 2017 vintages are expected to be just fine. For the most part grapes had been harvested already, and this year\u2019s crop shouldn\u2019t be affected since the vines were bare.\n\nEven where the flames did sweep across hillsides and come dangerously close to licking the side of buildings, like at the delightful luxury boutiquey Poetry Inn in the Staggs Leap District (theirs was an incredibly last-minute save thanks to the LA Fire Department and shifting winds), several months later there\u2019s almost no trace. In January the whole valley was actually incredibly green and lush, with bright yellow mustard starting to bloom and grass covering the charred hills \u2014 a result of the mineral-rich soil left behind after the fire.\n\nLas Alcobas Napa Valley\n\nStill-new and unaffected Las Alcobas Napa Valley is a retreat just outside the main drag of St. Helena, set beside Beringer\u2019s estate vineyards, which make for a stunning setting, especially with the rooms\u2019 vineyard-facing terraces and balconies boasting fire pits or soaking tubs. Its Acacia House restaurant is drawing fans of its chef Chris Cosentino\u2019s beloved offal-heavy Cockscomb restaurant in San Francisco, for seasonal, sustainable dishes ranging from a fantastic pork schnitzel to caviar-topped chips and dip. Down the road is another compelling reason for a wine-country getaway: Los Angeles restaurateur Sang Yoon\u2019s Two Birds/One Stone (with chef Douglas Keane, a Japanese yakitori\u2013inspired restaurant\u2014sharing a building with a winery, naturally \u2014 serving to-die-for kimchee-brined fried chicken with Korean buffalo sauce.\n\nCalistoga\n\nCalistoga up the road was significantly affected by the fire along with other regions like Atlas Peak and Mt. Vreeder, but on the latter there were properties like the reservation-only Outpost Wines \u2014 known especially for its juicy Zinfandels \u2014 that survived. The fire didn\u2019t affect the recent opening of The Ink House on the way to Rutherford, an 1800s house that once slept Elvis Presley and was reimagined as a hyper-luxurious B&B with butler-style service (not to mention plentiful Castellucci wine by the same family) and Bentley house car for dropoffs and pickups at new hot spots like The Charter Oak (for a mouthwatering meal of fire-cooked meats and inventive veggies) or for exclusive tastings at Edge Hill Estate, one of the oldest fine wine estates in the area. And nearby, Round Pond Estate makes for a dreamy day of wine tasting, olive oil tasting, garden tours and, to cap it all off, the completely seasonal (and mostly locally grown), family-style Il Pranzo lunch.\n\nDowntown Napa\n\nDowntown Napa is undergoing a resurgence of late, which was actually in some ways prompted by a different natural disaster: the 2014 6.0 earthquake. In the years since, it's been rebuilding and rethinking, and one of the most exciting businesses to come of it is Archer Napa Valley, a new five-star design-forward hotel of 183 beautiful rooms outfitted with wine fridges that will soon be surrounded by more fine dining, tasting rooms and live-music venues as part of the fresh First Street Napa development. As of now the new Charlie Palmer Steak is the place to be both for savory meals and after hours, but come spring the rooftop opening \u2014 with Napa\u2019s first rooftop pool \u2014 is sure to be a game-changer.\n\nSonoma\n\nIn Sonoma, the longtime favorite Farmhouse Inn (Natalie Portman, Claire Danes and Kate Bosworth have all stayed) hosted two weddings just after the danger passed their location, but a couple staff lost their homes, which was the case at many places such as famed eatery Girl & the Fig, too. The fires did a lot of damage to the parks that make Sonoma such a destination for nature lovers, too. Fun fact: Only six percent of Sonoma County land is planted with grape vineyards, despite having more than 425 wineries. Sugarloaf Ridge State Park reopened February 1 with infrastructure repaired by volunteers, and may actually have an even more spectacular spring wildflower bloom this season (there\u2019s a star party on February 10 at the Robert Ferguson Observatory), while a portion of Hood Mountain Regional Park (the Los Alamos Road entrance) with its beautiful trails just reopened too.\n\nFrom a hotel standpoint, Bodega Bay Lodge recently unveiled new suites and a refreshed restaurant, Drakes Sonoma Coast Kitchen, with a renovated hotel bar opening this year. Near downtown Santa Rosa is the up-and-coming arts neighborhood where The Astro Motel just opened, a stylish remodel of a 1963 motor lodge that\u2019s colorful, urbane and has special amenities for cyclists. The newest addition to buzzing downtown Healdsburg, meanwhile, is Harmon Guest House, with a rooftop terrace bar, which will be the latest addition to the acclaimed Hotel Healdsburg and h2 family when it debuts.\n\nThe devastation is perhaps a bit more obvious when driving around Sonoma, like through the town of Glen Ellen, where hundreds of structures burned. The burn stopped less than 50 feet away from Buena Vista Winery\u2019s stone tasting room, and the sixth-generation Gundlach Bundschu Winery just barely survived, with its tasting room and olive tree\u2013shaded picnic tables intact.\n\nThe Santa Barbara Area\n\nMuch further south of Santa Barbara in Ojai and Ventura, the fires raged, fueled by the Santa Ana winds. Then, the mudslides severely damaged not just homes but hotels in the latter. The Santa Ynez Valley and city of Santa Barbara were not affected, though when driving on the mountainous route of Highway 154 there\u2019s evidence of a previous fire. In Santa Ynez, a charming town that marks the start of the Central Coast\u2019s wine region, the Santa Ynez Inn boasts a fresh renovation to rooms, a new whisky tasting program, and charming indoor and outdoor spaces with fire pits and fireplaces. It\u2019s an elegant yet cozy place to base yourself for tasting the valley\u2019s favorite vinos such as at Sunstone and Alma Rosa, and trying out new restaurants like the delicious Mad & Vin and exceptional SY Kitchen, which is just blocks away.\n\nGoleta and Summerland were also free of damage, so places like Hotel Californian and Pinot Noir\u2013producing Summerland Winery are open for business, too. Which is to say, now's an excellent time to indulge in California wines at the source.", "title": "What Is California Wine Country Like After the Fires?"}, {"url": "://explore/section/q/Napa%20Valley%20AVA/Napa%20Valley%20AVA?ned=us", "content": "", "title": ""}, {"url": "://explore/section/q/Santa%20Rosa/Santa%20Rosa?ned=us", "content": "", "title": ""}], "occurence_date": "08 Oct 2012", "occurence_timestamp": 1349677583020, "magnitude": 5.9, "actual_city": "California"}, {"news": [{"url": "https://entertainment.mb.com.ph/2018/02/26/transgender-artists-make-history-at-the-oscars/", "content": "Transgender artists make history at the Oscars 0 SHARES Share it!

Zardes also had a good chance in the 51st minute on a header and came up empty on another one-on-one opportunity in the 64th.\n\nColumbus goalkeeper Zack Steffen and Philadelphia's Andre Blake each made three saves.\n\nCzech playmaker Borek Dockal made his first start for the Union (1-0-1) and CJ Sapong, who set the single-season scoring record last season for Philadelphia, signed a new contract with the club earlier in the week.\n\nThe first scoreless game of the season in the MLS snapped Philadelphia's four-game home winning streak.\n\nD.C. 2, Houston 2\n\nBOYDS, Md. (AP)\u2014Luciano Acosta scored in second-half stoppage time and D.C. United rallied from a two-goal deficit to tie the Houston Dynamo 2-2 on Saturday at the Maryland SoccerPlex.\n\nDarren Mattocks scored in his second straight game to pull United (0-1-2) within 2-1 in the 49th minute when he eluded his defender at the corner of the 6-yard box and sent a shot past goalkeeper Chris Seitz. Acosta, who was suspended for opening weekend and came off the bench for the final 28 minutes last Sunday, was left alone at the far post and one-touched Frederic Brillant's header off Seitz and in.\n\nD.C. United's new Audi Field wasn't ready for the home opener, so a sold-out crowd of 4,000 attended the alternate venue. Last week, D.C. United faced Atlanta United in front of an MLS regular-season record crowd of 72,035 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.\n\nAlberth Elis opened the scoring in the 30th minute for Houston (1-1-1) by hustling to win a back-header, chipping it over goalkeeper David Ousted and tapping it home. Seconds later, Elis capitalized on another defensive mistake, got to the edge of the 18-yard box and found an open Mauro Manotas in front of goal for a calm finish.\n\nMinnesota 2, Chicago 1\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP)\u2014Ibson scored his first MLS goal in the second half, Sam Nicholson added another 11 minutes later and Minnesota United beat the Chicago Fire 2-1 on Saturday in its home opener.\n\nIbson gave Minnesota (2-1-0) a 1-0 lead in the 55th minute. His header was saved by Richard Sanchez, but Ibson was first to the rebound for a finish with the outside of his foot. After Chicago tied it four minutes later, Nicholson finished Ethan Finlay's well-placed cross with an open header to freeze Sanchez.\n\nWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE SAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM\n\n\n\nYou are the entering the Highlight Zone \u00bb https://t.co/OkFRGmLTCK pic.twitter.com/Y8ab5hIuhQ \u2014 Minnesota United FC (@MNUFC) March 17, 2018\n\nRookie Elliot Collier, making his first start, scored his first MLS goal for Chicago (0-2-0).

Three Toronto defenders focused on the Impact captain, leaving Vargas open on the right side to take the pass and slice a shot inside the goalpost in the 41st minute for their first lead in three games.\n\nPiatti was inside the Toronto penalty area on two more occasions before the break but Nick Hagglund blocked one dangerous shot and another was also turned away.\n\nEight minutes into the second half, Piatti sent Taider in alone but Alexander Bono pushed the shot.\n\nToronto threatened in the 64th when Sebastian Giovinco got the ball to striker Jozy Altidore. He lifted a shot over goalie Evan Bush but saw it bounce just wide.

Martinez, a 24-year old who was fourth in MLS with 19 goals last season, converted from the spot moments later.\n\nAtlanta's Julian Gressel tapped a cross from the right side that deflected off Vancouver's Aaron Maund for an own goal and, about two minutes later, Martinez scored from the top of the box to make it 3-0. On the counterattack, Miguel Almiron fed Martinez on a breakaway for the easy one-on-one finish in the 60th minute.\n\nVancouver's Erik Hurtado, in his first appearance this season, slipped behind the defense, ran onto a long arcing pass from Jordon Mutch and rolled the ball past goalkeeper Brad Guzan in the 85th.\n\nMartinez capped the scoring in the 88th with a leaping header off a cross from Andrew Carleton.\n\nFrom the Homegrown.\n\nFor the Hat trick.\n\n\n\nFirst MLS assist for @andrewcarleton7 to @JosefMartinez17 \ud83c\udfa9 pic.twitter.com/LZnMgYebzc \u2014 Atlanta United FC (@ATLUTD) March 18, 2018\n\nAtlanta (2-1-0) out shot the Whitecaps 21-5.\n\nKansas City 3, San Jose 2\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo.

Intrigued, you open it. Flipping through its fraying pages, you discover a series of candid poses featuring your great grandparents back in those distant years when they were roughly the same age you are now.\n\n\n\nSomething about the look in their eyes strikes a chord\u2014a mixture, you think with hindsight, of wonderment and cluelessness. You ask yourself: what were they thinking?\n\nDecades before you were born, these hale, frosty-faced relatives, evincing grins from their snowy past, stand in vaulted white ramparts, the curves of topography recognizable to you\u2014and yet the landscapes rimming your home valley seem so strangely different.\n\nBut there your ancestors are: bundled contentedly against the elements, riding packed trams to the legendary powderamas of yore; ascending with their skis and snowboards to destinations like Rendezvous Bowl in Jackson Hole, Wyoming; the black diamond runs of Grand Targhee, Idaho; to the crest of Lone Peak towering over Big Sky, Montana, mugging for cellphone cameras along the ridge at Bridger Bowl and the slopes of Red Lodge.\n\nTheir snapshots offer a vicarious glimpse. Savoring what old-timers called \u201cdownhill skiing\u2019s golden age\u201d in the Northern Rockies, they hit the piste in late November and didn\u2019t quit until mid-April. Then, like clockwork come springtime, they\u2019d pull out their boats, and greet the first insect hatches on annual pilgrimages, and delight in leaving the first set of tracks by foot and bike. They convinced themselves it would always be like that. Judging by the images in front of you, it looked like they lived a charmed carefree life indeed, if you were privileged enough to have it before the changes set in.\n\nNow in your own time it\u2019s the latter weeks of winter in the late 2060s or what used to be called that cold-weather season. You find the notion of a \u201cdownhill ski industry\u201d and lives ordered around nothing more than outdoor leisure to be peculiar and frankly unbelievable given misery now in the world.\n\nOn this afternoon, it\u2019s drizzling, same as it was in late January and February; the thermometer is pushing past 60 degrees. The intermittent snow in town, which lasted a couple of weeks, disappeared more than a month ago. Tulip sprigs have been pressing out of the soil for weeks and very soon, lilac bloom.\n\nIntrigued by the haunting white backdrops that met earlier members of your kin, you set out to find the elusive snow line where depth this time of year, according to historic records, was measured in feet.\n\nAs you wheel in a driverless autonomous car through Greater Bozeman/Gallatin Valley, population 420,000, you think nothing of the scattered subdivisions stretching for 40 miles because it\u2019s all you\u2019ve ever known \u2014farmland that octogenarians say gave way to sprawl a generation before. It\u2019s hard to fathom that the vista in front of you was ever dubbed \u201cthe valley of the flowers\u201d by indigenous buffalo hunters and subsequently touted as the best cropland in the state by the white settlers who followed.\n\nDryland agriculture became unworkable in unrelenting heatwaves\u2014square footage and real estate lots worth far more as tradable commodities than beef raised on the hoof or wheat shipped out by the bushel.\n\nOf course, then, too, came the contentious never-ending battles over water\u2014the years when personal green manicured lawns went away with the advent of mandatory water restrictions, when ranchers and farmers made fortunes in the water development business.\n\nSummers with only a few days of temperatures soaring through the nineties past the century mark in your forebears\u2019 era now broil over 90 degrees for stretches of a month or more. The haze of woodsmoke that tinged their air in July at the turn of the century wafts in now from the west two months earlier, obscuring views of the mountains on many days.\n\nFew could\u2019ve predicted that when extreme heat events (high temperatures routinely in the 120s) coupled with shortages of freshwater caused social unrest a thousand miles away in the desert Southwest, from Vegas to California's Mojave, Phoenix and Tucson, it would also set off an exodus.\n\nNor, correspondingly, could anyone have grasped a different chain of events that linked Greater Yellowstone to the oceans: rising seas pushed by tropical storm surges causing hundreds of billions of dollars in damage to coastal developments, submerging some, sending huge numbers of residents scrambling inland when insurance companies no longer were willing to pay policy owners to rebuild or the companies went bankrupt.\n\nYet it happened. More than a million desperate \u201cenvironmental refugees\u201d poured into different corners of Greater Yellowstone on top of the others who originally came seeking the good life. As for what happened to Greater Yellowstone\u2019s famous wildlife, well, that will be explored in another story.\n\nNow, along the four-lane highway leading down Gallatin Canyon to Big Sky, a corridor of roadway three times as wide as the Gallatin River itself, you find every bend of the river on this March day crowded with masses of gray-headed diehard anglers waiting their turns to cast; each knows the current will be dipping fast as another short fishing season is brought to a close.\n\nIt\u2019s an odd ritual they do in remembrance of a pastime that long ago lost its meaning. Just as it is difficult to conceive of a \u201cski industry\u201d as once being a major pillar of the winter economy in the Rockies, so, too, is it a weird notion to ponder there ever being a thriving multi-million-dollar \u201cflyfishing industry.\u201d\n\nThe Gallatin River\u2014formerly one of Montana\u2019s crown liquid jewels that flows out of Yellowstone National Park\u2014is still regaled for being a location in the quaint 20th century fairy tale, A River Runs Through It.\n\nOn May 1 every year, the state of Montana shutters rivers to angling and rafting because of low flows and an attempt to reduce human stress on what remains of dwindling wild-reared trout populations. No matter, you can still fish simply by slipping in your Virtual Reality contact lenses and catch any species you desire.\n\n\u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0\n\nBack in the real world of 2068, low flows and warm temperatures on the Gallatin are mirrored on every stream in the region\u2014the Madison, Yellowstone, Big Horn, Jefferson, Shoshone, even the Snake in Jackson Hole where calls on water made by farmers in Idaho for irrigation have created huge tensions with federal land management agencies trying to keep enough aqua between the banks for fish and wildlife. Those summer days when a thousand inner tubers cooled off in July and August floating down the Madison River west of Bozeman? A distant memory. Now you can leapfrog the channel without getting your feet wet.\n\nA perk for the Gallatin; its cfs (cubic feet per second) flows are augmented with a perpetual release of treated sewage water dumped into the river channel because Big Sky proper, population 30,000, had no other place to put it.\n\nEncircling Lone Mountain, the forested panorama of evergreens present in the old family photos is now a mixture of dead arboreal snags killed by mountain beetles, black patches where fire swept through, and bare, brush-covered slopes where trees did not naturally grow back . One can also take note of the clearcuts that politicians authorized the U.S. Forest Service to carry out, based on the faulty premise that felling the forest of its old trees would prevent wildfire; now it is merely a testament to monumentally misguided thinking. Grasses and brush infernos still broke out from lightning strikes and careless human activity because climate change every summer transformed them into tinder.\n\nAs you leave U.S. Highway 191 and wend westward toward the old Big Sky Resort, there\u2019s another thing up the valley that didn\u2019t exist in your great grandparents\u2019 snapshots: a road that was pushed through the Madison Mountains as an artery to reach the Madison Valley, hastily blazed to provide a second emergency escape route for panicked citizens dealing with fears of fire and the potential of earthquakes. That, in turn, ignited an onslaught of development that poured into the Madison Valley turning many of the ranches not protected by conservation easements into massive real estate plays.\n\nSuch a vision, what some might consider dystopia, isn\u2019t a jeremiad coming from the mouth of a radical environmentalist. Rather, it\u2019s a prediction made by many experts thinking hard about climate change. Ski and trout towns, whose winter economies were built on the medium of frozen water, and the expectation it would also exist, are very different in the 2060s and their likely transformation, in a warming West, became harbingers.\n\nJackson Lake, liquid heart of Grand Teton National Park and important water source for the Snake River, on a recent late summer day. In that year, many reaches of the lake were left high and dry following drought conditions (expected to become the new norm with climate change) and irrigators in Idaho demanding that their water be released. In decades to come, whose interests will take precedent\u2014ecological and economic interests in Jackson Hole or potato growers downstream? Photo by Todd Wilkinson\n\nSo now, let\u2019s flash back. It is almost the year 2020.\n\nIn your great grandparents\u2019 era, politicians denied that such a future would ever be possible and citizens, who did not want to contemplate reality, kept re-electing them. In Washington, D.C, members of Congress waged constant war upon scientists who were studying human-caused climate change, denying any serious causal link between pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and rising temperature.\n\nThey systematically slashed the budgets of government science agencies. They said nothing when political appointees, who worked previously as lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry, were brought into the U.S. departments of Interior, Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Emergency Management Administration and others, creating such hostile working conditions in government service that career scientists fled.\n\nBrazenly, they dismissed out of hand a number of warning calls. One of them was a report titled \u201c The Montana Climate Assessment \u201d prepared in late 2017 by the Montana Institute on Ecosystems, overseen by leading scientists at both Montana State University in Bozeman and the University of Montana in Missoula. Research informing the report\u2019s conclusions was underwritten by a $20-million grant from the National Science Foundation, an independent federal agency and one of the most respected scientific bodies in the world.\n\nDr. Cathy Whitlock, a professor in MSU\u2019s Department of Earth Sciences then, and one of the lead authors, told a reporter the reason for the report was to deliver a regional assessment of likely climate-related outcomes in Montana pertaining to forestry, agriculture and water. Her colleagues said the findings could generally also be extrapolated to the neighboring states of more arid Wyoming and Idaho.\n\nPreviously, the International Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had prepared a number of global assessments that identified macro-issues but none that drilled deeper into eco-regions like the Northern Rockies and the interconnected high plains. It should be noted that professor emeritus Dr. Steven Running, then at the University of Montana, had been part of a team, separate from Whitlock\u2019s, that received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for its pioneering work in pondering the cause-and-effect of climate change.\n\nSo compelling was their wake-up call that even the U.S. Department of Defense, in the Pentagon\u2019s regular Quadrennial Reports for the four branches of the military, referred to climate change as both a serious national security risk and a major challenge to American interests around the world.\n\nThe Montana Climate Assessment involved a comprehensive congealing of historic temperature, crop and water data, a thorough review of existing peer-reviewed science and it used sophisticated computer modeling, given trendlines, to project likely scenarios as it relates to greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere.\n\nDr. Cathy Whitlock, professor of Earth Sciences and research fellow at Montana Institute on Ecosystems. Whitlock, also involved with the relationship between wildfire and climate, was a lead author of the recent Montana Climate Assessment. st century. In 2017, Whitlock said Montana had experienced an average rise of between two- and three-degrees since 1950. She and colleagues concluded that temperatures going forward would warm between four and six degrees more by the middle of the 21century.\n\nTo put this in perspective, even a small rise in temperature can result in \u201caverage\u201d low precipitation years plunging into full-on drought conditions; meanwhile, \u201cnormal\u201d drought conditions can quickly escalate into the severe category when streams feeding rivers run bone dry or are reduced to trickles. It also affects the \u201crecharge\u201d of underground aquifers that are fed by surface water which normally passes nearly unseen through the landscape.\n\nIn the three decades that followed the 1990s, when climate change data first started to accumulate and droughts became called \u201cthe new normal\u201d in the West, impacts to farmers\u2019 crops and ranchers\u2019 livestock inflicted billions of dollars in negative economic impact and costs associated with federal disaster relief. On top of it, billions of dollars annually during the first two decades of the new millennium were spent by the U.S. Forest Service fighting wildfires, consuming half of the agency\u2019s operating budget and hobbling its ability to do other things.\n\nThis could be anywhere, and will be everywhere. Photo courtesy NPS\n\nIn a different breathtaking analysis published by the National Academies, it suggests forests as we recognize them today will vanish: \"Continued warming could completely transform Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem fire regimes by the mid-21st century, with profound consequences for many species and for ecosystem services including aesthetics, hydrology, and carbon storage,\" the authors write.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The conditions associated with extreme fire seasons are expected to become much more frequent, with fire occurrence and area burned exceeding that observed in the historical record or reconstructed from paleoproxy records for the past 10,000 years. Even in years without extreme fire events, average annual area burned is projected to increase, and years with no large fires\u2014common until recently\u2014are projected to become increasingly rare.\"\n\n\n\nStill, some claim that climate change means good news, that warmer temperatures will yield longer growing seasons. That\u2019s true so long as it is accompanied by adequate moisture.\n\nSuch sanguine thinking also was rebuffed by forerunning geographer John Wesley Powell in the late 19th century who warned that homesteaders who believed rain would, by the providence of God, follow their plows were fools. And for much of the 20th century, many rural areas of the West emptied out. William deBuys, the great Powell historian, wrote in his biography, \u201cSeeing Things Whole: The Essential John Wesley Powell\u201d: \u201cMany thousands of families made a go of trying to farm without irrigation in the arid lands, and they suffered extremely. It was a bitter double cross on those hopeful people, and Powell saw it.\u201d\n\nWith climate change, what happens when the irrigation ditches run dry?\n\nIn the interior West, known for its aridity, experts say there will be another month or two of conditions suitable for growing grains in the middle of the 21st century, and that more moisture will likely come as rain rather than snow.\n\nHowever, it is also replete with an insidious paradox, scientists say. Warmer temperatures mean that enough added moisture must fall from the sky to offset the drying out of soils caused by hotter daytime temperatures as well as water that\u2019s lost to evaporation or isn\u2019t available as snowmelt.\n\nRivers are destined to chronically have their flows squeezed, Whitlock and colleagues say. Sorting out who will get priority in water use\u2014agriculture/irrigators, municipalities (flows at the tap, lawn and garden watering), developers buying up rights, or ecology (such as keeping enough water in streams to ensure fish populations can persist) could bring major cultural conflict.\n\nMoreover, there will be a lot of tough decisions with which society will need to contend: should, for example, water be pulled out of streams in order to feed non-native cattle by growing alfalfa when that same resource is crucial to the welfare of people and the survival of native wildlife?\n\nStartlingly, Whitlock also noted this: if the status quo of CO2 emissions continues unabated or increases as a result of burning more fossil fuels now being promoted by the Trump Administration, the end of the 21st century could actually see a temperature rise of around nine to twelve degrees. For dryland farming in Montana, it would be catastrophic. \u201cIf those temperature increases happen, it will literally be a different world, unlike the one we presently know,\u201d she said.\n\nFor dryland farming in Montana, it would be catastrophic. \u201cIf those temperature increases happen, it will literally be a different world, unlike the one we presently know.\" \u2014Dr. Cathy Whitlock, senior scientist at Montana State University\n\nSteve Running believes southwest Montana\u2019s climate within two human generations will resemble that of Salt Lake City\u2019s and arid stretches of the Great Basin. In the rural interior of Wyoming away from the mountains, where summer temperatures can already be scorching, conditions likely will be far more problematic, waterwise. Plus, there are major metropolitan areas, with political influence, already hoping to sink straws into water in the inland West and pipe it, like oil, to serve their needs.\n\nRunning scoffs at notions that spending millions of dollars in cloud seeding will make an appreciable difference against declining snowpacks. And, he chuckles at the irony that the same science-denying politicians who embrace manipulative cloud seeding reject the notion that human influence affects climate.\n\nWhen people talk about \u201cadaptation,\u201d he adds, many think of slow incremental\u2014i.e. orderly and measured\u2014responses to climate change, but events could force a more drastic, nonlinear response, particularly if climate change accelerates.\n\nThis could hasten something completely unplanned for\u2014environmental refuges ( read Jeff Goodell's piece in Rolling Stone ) involving people being forced to move closer to where the water is. The Greater Yellowstone region sits at the headwaters of three major river systems\u2014the Snake-Columbia; Yellowstone-Missouri-Mississippi; and Green-Colorado.\n\nAt stake is the very way we think and interact with the landscape around us. Here is just one minor touchstone; the city of Bozeman is rapidly racing toward the point where its water capacity, capable of serving the present population via Hyalite Reservoir and nearby tributaries will be maxed out. There may be pushes made to shore up more water storage capacity that could mean building more impoundments in mountain draws where streams presently flow wild and serve as the last refugia for native wild fish.\n\nWarmer temperatures, as mentioned earlier, mean less snow and more rain. \u201cThe snow season we currently have won\u2019t last as long and it will likely end abruptly,\u201d Whitlock said.\n\nTo most people, the changes are still almost imperceptible but it\u2019s the gradual deepening effects that could be transformative\u2014in the altered timing of runoff, the pollination of plants, when greenup happens, when trees die or burn, when humans are forced to give up what they used to do.\n\n\n\nIn March 2018, experts with the National Academies of Sciences released its Fourth National Climate Assessment , drawing upon thousands of studies from around the world. On the macro-level, the findings were stunning (see them at the end of this article).\n\n\u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0\n\nSki towns because of their location in the higher elevation will be hit hard. As one scientists told me, \u201cFor about seven generations, the thinking and identity of the rural West has sprung from its assumed relationship to water, the ability to manipulate it, count on it being there, and that\u2019s what had laid the groundwork for economic and social stability. You could set your watch by seasons. But half a century from now that will be gone, replaced by disruptions to routines and then abandoning of them.\u201d\n\nRegarding the future of winter, one of the experts sounding the alarm has a one-of-a-kind niche in the U.S. ski industry. He is concerned, in particular, about what awaits mountain communities. Auden Schendler works for one of the best-known outdoor snow sport corporations in the world, the Aspen Skiing Company.\n\nWhat Schendler and others describe as Greater Yellowstone\u2019s possible climate-related futureshock can be applied to other hamlets throughout the Rockies. \u201cClimate change isn\u2019t coming,\u201d Schendler explains. \u201cIt\u2019s already here; we\u2019re at the front-end now. But we can alter the future for those who will be looking back. The only question is: will they be praising us for taking action or cursing us for what we didn\u2019t do?\u201d\n\n\u201cClimate change isn\u2019t coming. It\u2019s already here; we\u2019re at the front-end now. The only question is: will our ancestors be praising us for taking action or cursing us for what we didn\u2019t do?\u201d \u2014 Auden Schendler\n\nAn ardent recreationist and a family man with bills to pay, Schendler has been called a cognitive dissident, conscientious objector, and, to ski destinations that want to keep pretending there isn\u2019t a problem of culpability, a gadfly. He actually gets paid to think defiantly about not only the connection between climate change and business but the relationship between economy and ecology\u2014and how the health of the latter supports the former.\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke vows to radically alter the management of public lands in the West, gutting environmental laws and unleashing an unprecedented push to extract oil, gas and coal in order to secure \u201cAmerican energy dominance,\" code for burning a lot of fossil fuels.\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke vows to radically alter the management of public lands in the West, gutting environmental laws and unleashing an unprecedented push to extract oil, gas and coal in order to secure \u201cAmerican energy dominance,\" code for burning a lot of fossil fuels.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has argued that climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese. U.S. Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, a dear friend of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, has notoriously asserted that climate change \u201cis the greatest hoax ever perpetuated on the American people.\u201d\n\nIn Wyoming, politicians at every government level, from school boards to state legislature, have moved to strike mention of climate change form text books and ordered the removal of art installations at the University of Wyoming addressing the impacts of climate on forests. Notably, the actual football field turf at the University of Wyoming is called The Jonah Field which honors the largest natural gas field in the state\u2014one that even former Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal said was a sacrifice zone for wildlife and an example of how not to develop fossil fuels. Yet that is exactly the kind of full-field development Zinke envisions.\n\nDuring an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News, U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who established her residency to run for office in the Jackson Hole town of Wilson, declared that \"the science [of climate change] is just simply bogus, you know, we know that temperatures have been stable for the last 15 years.\"\n\nClimate skeptics, however, cannot erase the data or the physical evidence rapidly mounting on the ground. If by \"stable\" Cheney means consistently rising temperatures, she is correct. Scientists with the National Academies note that, through last year, the last 17 years since the new millennium began were all counted among the hottest recorded in modern human times, except for one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne also wonders how much time Ms. Cheney has spent conversing with scientists from the National Academies or hiking the woods of Greater Yellowstone with ecologists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0\n\n\n\n\n\nYellowstone winterkeeper Steven Fuller, a Mountain Journal columnist who has spent 45 years in the center of America\u2019s first national park which, in turn forms the biological heart of Greater Yellowstone, has witnessed the changes firsthand. Wetlands where he took photographs two decades ago are dried up. Gone are the frogs and toads that used to be common. The fire season is two months longer, there\u2019s earlier melt out and there\u2019s a dearth of moose which he doesn\u2019t blame on wolves but drier landscape. [In Minnesota, moose declines are linked primarily to parasites now proliferating in and being passed along by white-tailed deer (doing better in a warmer climate) in addition to predation by wolves and rising temperatures].\n\n\u201cThe deep onset of winter in Yellowstone, the stretches of extreme cold, have become rarer and rarer,\u201d Fuller says. \u201cDeep cold brought a special feeling to the park interior. It used to last for months and it only happened a couple of days this year and it\u2019s getting briefer.\u201d Deep cold and a huge snowpack also favored species that evolved with it.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides being the senior vice president of sustainability for Aspen Snowmass, Schendler has served as board president of Protect Our Winters , a no-holds-barred nonprofit that has more than 130,000 supporters around the globe. Its primary target is first getting the ski industry and outdoor gear manufacturers to wake up, educate and mobilize hundreds of millions of outdoor sports enthusiasts around the world, then turn up the heat on Congress, governors, state houses and even local chambers of commerce.\n\nAuden Schendler, vice president of sustainability at Aspen Snowmass. Schendler and Protect Our Winters founder Jeremy Jones note that as the past few years have set global records as the warmest in modern times, more than a million square miles of snowpack\u2014 an area equal in size to three Texases\u2014that would ordinarily exist in spring has disappeared since 1970. The same as epic areas of sea ice cover in the Arctic north has shrunken back and the ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica are in accelerating melt or cracking off into the ocean.\n\n\u201cl ow snow years have negative impacts on the economy. We found that the increased skier participation levels in high snow years meant an extra $692.9 million in value added and 11,800 extra jobs compared to the 2001\u20132016 average. In low snow years, reduced participation decreased value added by over $1 billion and cost 17,400 jobs compared to an average season.\" In a 2018 report released by Protect Our Winters, researchers said,\n\nWhat happens when low snow years become chronic and when those dollars stop trickling through local economies? In Greater Yellowstone, nature-tourism related to just Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks is a $1 billion annual industry. Add in the commerce related to skiing, fishing, wildlife watching, recreation, hunting and guest lodges outside the parks and you can add a few billion dollars more, says Ray Rasker of Headwaters Economics. The health of nature also serves as the lucrative lynchpin of real estate. There's no better example than the ultra-exclusive Yellowstone Club in Big Sky that has its own private members-only ski area.\n\nI first met Schendler in 2014. I listened to him address the Jackson Hole SHIFT Festival on outdoor recreation, saying things about climate change the rest of his snowsports industry and purveyors of winter-oriented outdoor gear and apparel wouldn\u2019t touch. I was shocked not only by his clear articulation of the science, all of which was backed by studies, but also by his chutzpah. Schendler said things that no ski resort executive will or real estate broker. They make their livings on speculation, on self-interest and on short-term get-in-while-the getting-is-good kind of thinking.\n\nWere Schendler a federal employee working for the Trump Administration, saying the stuff that he shares would be liable to get one fired. But not only does he still have a job, and has been told by his boss that his back is covered, but his message, in spite of organized campaigns of disinformation spun to blunt it, is gaining traction. And most of all what he says is corroborated by science and what many are witnessing on the ground.\n\nA former reporter with High Country News, Schendler doesn\u2019t cloak his frustration with both the ski and larger outdoor recreation industries. When one thinks of all the fossil fuels burned to get skiers to western slopes, the amount of energy needed to operate the infrastructure and costs to heat second homes and buildings, it becomes clear it is one of the most carbon-intensive recreational pursuits.\n\nMany outdoor-recreation companies talk a good game but their actions, he says, actually amount to little more than greenwashing. In 2016, Schendler was asked to give a talk at the Outdoor Industry Association rendezvous in Denver. As he prepared his remarks, organizers wanted him to tone it down\u2014to focus not on swift attitude adjustments companies must make to slow climate change, but they wanted him to preach how business can still grow and thrive in a warming world.\n\nThey wanted him to paint a sanguine portrait, to suggest bullish investment conditions await for real estate in ski towns and to gloss over reality; they wanted him to tout better snowmaking, to say that the answer will simply be shifting the focus of outdoor recreation from winter to summer and shoulder seasons; they wanted him not to mention the ecological challenges that are coming for species that will be pushed to the edge. The Outdoor Industry Association wanted Schendler to basically say \u201cno worries\u201d and not utter anything negative about climate change because it\u2019s such a downer of a topic that neither the outdoor recreation industry nor the people it wants to sell products to want to hear. \u201cI told them, \u2018No. I won\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t sugar coat,\u2019\u201d Schendler said. They wanted Schendler to basically say \u201cno worries\u201d and not utter anything negative about climate change because it\u2019s such a downer of a topic that neither the outdoor recreation industry nor the people it wants to sell products to want to hear.\n\n\u201cI told them, \u2018No. I won\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t sugar coat,\u2019\u201d Schendler said. \u201cThat head-in-sand perspective is pervasive and it feeds into the perception that climate change is only a silly preoccupation of a radical fringe instead of being the greatest challenge for civilization of our time.\u201d\n\nIn my own reporting as an environmental journalist, what Schendler mentions above is pervasive and it goes well beyond some members of the outdoor recreation industry. It is also pandemic in the real-estate and development industries; the attitude is that whatever happens in the future will be left for people generations from now to contend with.\n\nIt includes some CEOs, who have vacation homes in Greater Yellowstone, who are afraid to weigh in on the side of science and won\u2019t go near the topic of actually discussing limits on human consumption/use of wildlands to better the prospects for wildlife. Why? Because they are afraid of losing clout in their political and social groups.\n\nAnd there are many non-governmental conservation organizations that are so afraid of possibly alienating funders in the non-profit world they won\u2019t touch the problems of climate change, industrial strength outdoor recreation and its impact on what remains of the wild West soon to come under a huge strain from climate-related impacts.\n\n\n\nWhat Schendler and others\u2014including former Black Diamond mountaineering CEO Peter Metcalf and Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard\u2014are advancing involves an operational question. It goes far beyond the bounds of existing balance sheets pertaining to investments in snowmaking, lift capacity, real estate, building warm season mountain biking trails to service growing numbers of warm-weather visitors or even believing that fortresses can be erected around exclusive gated communities to wall climate change out. Metaphorically, will the fortunes of ski areas in the future be turned to sand? Scientists say the snowsport industry's days of prominence, as we know them today, are numbered yet there remains stiff resistance to confronting the very issue that is causing its demise. NPS photo/Joseph Tumidalsky It\u2019s analogous to NASA, Schendler says, identifying that an asteroid is on a direct collision course with Earth. Yet unlike that scenario, climate change, he notes, is occurring and any hope of slowing its effects depends on a singular action: reducing the amount of carbon being pumped into the atmosphere. (It must be noted here that Patagonia is a supporter of Mountain Journal but there are no editorial connections between MJ and Patagonia. Indeed, the interview with Chouinard, below, happened before Mountain Journal was launched in August 2016).\n\n\u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0\n\nApart from rationalizing inaction on climate change, based on the argument that it comes with huge costs and requires all of us changing the way we live, Schendler says politicians, corporations and citizens also avoid addressing \u201cthe moral piece\u201d of responsibility to future generations. \u201cIt\u2019s really about how we want to live our lives, and what obligations we have as parents and citizens, even as job providers, to take big-picture steps to address the problem,\u201d he says, then invokes something profound. \u201cThe way to do that actually costs almost nothing, but carries risk and exposure: it\u2019s to use our voice and influence to speak out and force elected officials to move.\u201d\n\nThe National Ski Areas Association, representing more than 300 alpine resorts accounting for 90 percent of skier/snowboarder visits nationwide, has a program to reduce carbon emissions and recognizes the need to become more political around climate and to coerce member organizations into action, Schendler says.\n\nFor them, it is a survival issue. Given current carbon emissions and lack of action, climate change stands to render many of NSAA\u2019s member resorts no longer viable. Notably, Schendler added, Jackson Hole and Grand Targhee in Wyoming are on the list of \u201cclimate challengers\u201d taking modest action toward the ultimate goal of carbon neutrality. But Montana\u2019s Big Sky and Bridger Bowl are not.\n\nSchendler has brought along his boss, Mike Kaplan, CEO at Aspen, and Onno Wieringa, general manager at Utah\u2019s Alta who recently retired. Young people understand the urgency of climate change and they want to engage, he says; they just want to know how. They are willing to make sacrifices as long as they are spelled out and involve their elders sharing the burden. The Millennials/Gen Zers that Schendler talks to are also resentful of their Baby Boomer and Generation X parents and grandparents creating an epochal environmental problem that is theirs to inherit.\n\nClimate change is the greatest existential threat to the ski industry and merely believing the answer resides with tweaking a business model and becoming four season developments, is ignoring reality. Climate change is the greatest existential threat to the ski industry and merely believing the answer resides with tweaking a business model and becoming four season developments, is ignoring reality. In his travels across the West, trying to engage citizens, Schendler notes that young people want to work for companies that not only believe in diversity and sustainability but evince an environmental consciousness in their business practices. And he adds that companies demonstrating social responsibility are using it to attract smarter, more committed employees. \u201cPeople, especially those with children, want to work for companies doing the right thing,\u201d he told me.\n\nBusinessman Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and an outspoken promoter of sustainability, corporate altruism in addressing climate change, and healthy environments, is featured in the February 2018 edition of National Geographic with NatGeo 's Editor in Chief Susan Goldberg\n\nCompanies that are openly committed to environmental protection are attracting top-flight talent entering the workforce. When Goldberg asked Bloomberg what role big employers play in the environment, Bloomberg replied, \"Why will a corporation be environmentally friendly? Today, if you go and recruit on campus for the best and brightest, they [young people] interview you. They ask, What are you doing for the environment? Employees want to work for an environmentally-friendly company. And then there are investors. If you talk to the managers of the big pensions and endowments, they want socially responsible investing. We don't buy coal stocks, gun stocks, tobacco stocks.\"\n\nThe fact that snow will disappear beneath skis should actually be the least of worries for those in mountain towns, Schendler says. At the urging of Wieringa and Metcalf, 14 resorts in Utah sent a letter to Governor Gary Herbert in 2016 pointing out that 70 percent of Salt Lake City\u2019s drinking water comes from snowpack and 80 percent of the state\u2019s freshwater goes to farmers and ranchers. They also noted that by 2050, Utah\u2019s population is expected to double to 6 million. \u201cDo I find it a little ridiculous to be pondering whether we\u2019ll have a ski season 50 years from now given what other more serious priorities will be?\u201d Metcalf asks. \u201cCompletely. But whatever it takes. If businesses with the most engaged passionate audiences don\u2019t step forward, there\u2019s no hope.\u201d\n\nPeter Metcalf, photo courtesy Peter Metcalf As Schendler notes, Metcalf led the effort to move the Outdoor Retailer convention out of Utah based on the state\u2019s regressive land use policies. \u201cThat was a $100 million economic hit to the state, and boon to Denver,\u201d Schendler says. \u201cI told Peter that the rationale might as well be climate, too, ie, Utah is just as regressive on climate. But the outdoor industry has been scared to speak so overtly about climate. Public land issues are a lot safer and easier to take on as a cause. But climate change could not only dramatically negatively alter the experience people have on public lands, but it will bring major disruptions to economies that depend on them.\u201d\n\nOutdoor recreation in the U.S. is worth around $800 billion annually in consumer spending and it is responsible for creating 6.1 million direct jobs, according to the Outdoor Industry Association. In Montana alone, outdoor recreation generates $5.8 billion in consumer spending, $1.5 billion of which flows as employee wages to 64,400 jobs. It is responsible for more than $400 million annually in local and state taxes, which fund schools and other essential services.\n\nClimate-related disruptions are likely to hit Teton County, Wyoming hard. Jackson Hole's entire economy is dependent on various forms of outdoor recreation. Its eye-pleasing scenery\u2014besides generous tax laws in the state\u2014attract the uber wealthy who can live anywhere they want. In 2015, The Charture Institute commissioned a report titled \" The Coming Climate: Ecological and Economic Impacts of Climate Change on Teton County \".\n\nThe analysis was led by authors Corinna Riginos, a conservation scientist, and Mark Newcomb, who is today a Teton County Commissioner. The conclusions they reach are sobering in laying out profoundly traumatic consequences for both the natural environment and commerce.\n\n\u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0\n\nClarion calls, however, have been sounding for years. In 2006, climatologist James Hansen, now retired from his high-profile job with NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Columbia University\u2019s Earth Institute, said carbon-intensive business-as-usual would be a \u201cguarantee of global and regional disasters.\u201d\n\nA growing group of business people and prominent outdoor folk, from Metcalf to Chouinard and Todd Spaletto of North Face share Schendler\u2019s and Hansen\u2019s contentions. Corroborated by an irrefutable body of scientific evidence, they say human-caused climate change isn\u2019t an abstraction; harbingers can be found everywhere. It\u2019s only a matter of connecting the dots. Why the CEOs of other major outdoor retailers and manufacturers aren\u2019t more vocal is not only a mystery to Schendler but an abrogation of the kind of corporate social responsibility they purport to represent.\n\nMany people point to recent \u201cepic\u201d snow accumulation in the mountains, but the real issue, scientists says, is when and how fast it melts and disappears. In decades to come, moisture that gathers in the mountains will mostly come as rainfall that doesn\u2019t hold high into summer. In 2017, northern Montana in the vicinity of Glacier National Park had huge snow accumulations and yet the park\u2019s famous historic backcountry lodge, Sperry Chalet, burned in a summer wildfire.\n\nIn August 2016, I drove to interview coal-industry officials in Gillette, Wyoming\u2014hub of the Powder River Basin\u2014to write a story about the link between the burning of carbon-intensive fossil fuels in power plants and greenhouse gasses, more evidence was visible.\n\nGiant plumes of woodsmoke poured into the sky from forest fires burning in Yellowstone National Park, while along U.S. Interstate 90 the Yellowstone River had been abruptly closed to fishing and boating for 180 miles. The catalyst for the shutdown of outdoor recreation: an outbreak of a lethal kidney-destroying disease in thousands of whitefish linked to warm water and low flows in the Yellowstone.\n\nChoking smoke returned in the summer of 2017 to the valleys of western Montana and so did closures of streams due to low water causing stress on fish. A study showed that in 2017 some $400 million was spent fighting wildfires and the disruptive impacts cost Montana $240 million (yes, a quarter of a billion dollars) in lost visitor spending.\n\nDan Vermillion, a Livingston, Montana-based purveyor of global fly-fishing trips and chairman of the Montana Fish, Wildlilfe and Parks Commission, said scientists whom he consulted blamed it on climate change. From his office in the Yellowstone River town, Vermillion described the closure as a sobering wake-up call for the recreation industry, especially fly fishing, which is a potent engine for the regional economy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing events happen with a frequency we\u2019ve never experienced before,\u201d Vermillion said. \u201cThe closure on the Yellowstone was a costly biggie but in fact we\u2019ve been witnessing a rising number of user restrictions occurring on other rivers for half a decade.\u201d\n\nWhen the Yellowstone River was shut down for three weeks in 2016, Vermillion said that business at a fly shop he once owned in Livingston dropped 95 percent in three days. Later, the same parasitic pathogen that killed whitefish, proliferative kidney disease, turned up in seven other major trout rivers in and near Greater Yellowstone, renowned globally for its blue-ribbon streams. And it was found again in 2017.\n\nSome 40 percent of people who came to Montana in recent years for fishing did so in Park County (adjacent to Yellowstone Park), where the Yellowstone River flows out of its eponymous national park. By the 2060s as much as 70 percent of prime cold-water mountain habitat for trout could be gone. A recent study carried out by the U.S. Geological Survey showed that trout populations in seven major river basins are already exhibiting signs of stress.\n\nWhen Vermillion was a boy growing up in Billings, Montana, August was the prime month for fishing. \u201cNow I don\u2019t book in August because of the uncertainty over water. In my world every place we do business\u2014Mongolia, Brazil, the Bahamas, Alaska, British Columbia and Montana\u2014has seen dramatic changes in what used to be considered \u2018normal water.\u2019 Fishing seasons were designed around when we had the most stable water conditions but it\u2019s all getting out of whack. You create a negative perception and then people stop coming and pretty soon you have a domino effect caused by changing climate.\u201d A public land user stands at an overlook above the South Fork of the Snake River, a popular destination for global anglers. It's a sighing vision mirrored on the Yellowstone, Upper Missouri and other rivers that define the character of Greater Yellowstone, their persistence threatened by losing snow and no political will to address the cause. Photo courtesy Bureau of Land Management Vermillion has kids. He is frustrated. And refusing to sit idle he decided in 2018 to run for the Montana state legislature saying that confronting climate change is the only wise decision to protect the lifestyle and economy Montanans enjoy. He is profoundly frustrated by the attitudes of Zinke, U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, and U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte.\n\nEspecially in the case of Daines and Gianforte. Both of them claim to be promoters of the new economy driven by technology, informed by science, and yet they have become boosters, along with Zinke, of trying to revive a moribund coal industry that is directly linked to exacerbating the problems of climate change.\n\nVermillion wondered aloud: how can two elected officials who claim to be champions of science and technological innovation blatantly push to keep the state\u2019s economy tethered to forms of energy production that are outdated, pose a long-term threat to quality of life of their constituents and has been hobbled most, not by environmental regulations but a glut of natural gas?\n\nZinke and Pruitt, the EPA administrator, have done more than downplay climate change or dismiss its reality. They have taken actions to reduce funding for research into climate change, mute civil servants who speak publicly about it, sow a climate of fear within civil service ranks which is devastating morale, and they have moved to streamline policies that will result in even more carbon being jettisoned into the atmosphere.\n\nIronic is that Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead, who grew up on a ranch in Jackson Hole, has demonstrated limited leadership in fostering real discussion about the negative impacts bearing down on his state. He seems to have an aversion for anything that flows out of the mouths of environmentalists.\n\nIn fact, in 2016 he said Wyoming's strategy would be to \"double down\" in promoting coal production. In fairness, he's in a tough economic spot though never has Mead stood up to lawmakers in challenging the scientific illiteracy that is rampant in the Wyoming legislature.\n\n\u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0\n\nAfter I returned from Gillette, Wyoming, Chouinard was passing through Bozeman. He doubts that affluent Americans are willing to inconvenience themselves with necessary lifestyle modifications to confront climate change. He said humans narcissistically deflect and point fingers but we never reflect on our impacts or hold ourselves accountable. Those who consume the most resources ought to be vilified, not held up as role models.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re self-centered consumers not citizens concerned about a greater good,\u201d Chouinard said. \u201cWe\u2019re electing people who are actually voting against our survival. It\u2019s just like being an alcoholic and being in denial that you\u2019re an alcoholic. And until we face up to that, nothing\u2019s going to happen.\u201d He has made elevating awareness of climate change a major focus of Patagonia\u2019s marketing. \u201cWe\u2019re self-centered consumers not citizens concerned about a greater good.

And until we face up to that, nothing\u2019s going to happen.\u201d \u2014Yvon Chouinard Zinke, experts say, needs to spend more time in the field with scientists who can show him concrete examples of change that is occurring beyond what is considered normal. What might he learn?\n\nOne point in this: even a seemingly small rise in average temperature can have big effects, ecologist Mike Tercek noted in a fairly recent special climate change edition of the journal Yellowstone Science . \u201cScientists predict that we will experience 3 to 8 degrees of warming in the next 100 years. In other words, the planet will experience about as much warming in the next 100 years as it did in the 8,000 years at the end of the last ice age, but this time it will be 30 to 80 times faster,\u201d he wrote.\n\nScientists with the National Academy of Sciences state that since 1979, climate change is to blame for half of the drying forests in the West, expanding wildfire areas by 16,000 square miles. In addition, research spelled out in a recent U.S. Department of Agriculture report said that for every couple of degrees the Fahrenheit rises, wildfire areas will quadruple in the West. And research notes that climate change is likely to result in more lightning\n\nProfessor Andrew Hansen, who oversees the Biodiversity Lab at Montana State University, was among four lead authors of a 2016 book, Climate Change in Wildlands , which offers a comprehensive overview of documented impacts and likely consequences for wild ecosystems. He recently elaborated on what it means for the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.\n\nAccording to Hansen, the number of days below zero F in Bozeman averaged 20 during the 1950s, yet 14 in the last decade and is trending toward fewer and fewer. And the decline in snowpack has reduced river flows by about 25 percent in the Yellowstone River since then. Due to the current low flows and warmer water temperatures, summer fishing restrictions are now the norm in rivers.\n\n\u201cI think the term climate change is more accurate than global warming,\u201d Vermillion says. \u201cOverall, things are warming and over decades that trend will prevail but in the meantime non-typical weather will be more profound, including oddly earlier and later snowstorms.\u201d\n\nIn spring 2017, it appeared that the Northern Rockies and high plains were well positioned with ample snowfall, but hot temperatures and no rainfall produced a \u201cflash drought\u201d in eastern Montana, punctuated by huge range fires. \"Those fires were huge and devastating to ranchers but they didn't seem to register around Bozeman,\" Whitlock said. Meanwhile, in the mountains, snowpack melted off fast and a lengthy fire season followed, cloaking the Gallatin Valley in thick unhealthy woodsmoke for more than a month.\n\nModels suggest that peak runoff will happen earlier in potentially short-term torrents of water and summers will begin with lower stream flows weeks ahead of the historic normal. \u201cLast year [2017] hit everybody by surprise but that kind of condition is more likely what you\u2019ll see in a future driven by warmer temperatures,\u201d Whitlock said.\n\n\u00b0 \u00b0 \u00b0", "title": "For Yellowstone And America, Climate Change Brings Our Moment Of Truth"}, {"url": "://explore/section/q/Yellowstone%20National%20Park/Yellowstone%20National%20Park?ned=us", "content": "", "title": ""}, {"url": "://explore/section/q/Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem/Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem?ned=us", "content": "", "title": ""}], "occurence_date": "10 Aug 2016", "occurence_timestamp": 1470797837510, "magnitude": 5.09, "actual_city": "Upper Lake, California"}]
